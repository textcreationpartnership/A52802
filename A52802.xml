            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I do here preſent you with the Walk and Work of a Chriſtian upon earth until he come [at the end] to Heaven, both theſe are weighty and worthy of all Acceptation.

'Tis a walk, wherein you may not only walk hand in hand with the Angels of God, [both thoſe that are Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtrial, to wit, Chriſtians, and thoſe that are Coeleſtial, to wit, <hi>Cherubims]</hi> but alſo with the God of Angels [himſelf] even as a Man walks hand in hand with his friend, thus <hi>Enoch</hi> walked with his God, <hi>Gen. 5. 24.</hi> Secondly, The work here is (verily) Angelical as well as Evangelical work, a work that is Honourable to the moſt Honourable upon Earth, giving more of Honour to them then it can receive of Honour from them. <hi>Deo ſervire eſt regnare,</hi> ſaith <hi>Auguſtin.</hi> And <hi>David</hi> accounted it a greater honour to be Gods Servant, then to be <hi>Iſraels</hi> King. <hi>Pſal. 18.</hi> Title.

            <p>HEre I preſent you with the Walk and Work of a Chriſtian upon Earth till he get to Heaven. Wherein, 1. Obſerve the matter. And, 2. The method hereof. 1. The matter is twofold: 1. Your Walk, and, 2. Your Work. 1. As to your Walk, there be three remarkable phraſes in the holy Scriptures, that (all) concern your Chriſtian Walk. 1. A walking [with] God. 2. A walking [before] God. And, 3. A walking [after] God. The firſt was that Walk of <hi>Enoch,</hi> who is ſaid to walk [with] God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 5. 22, 24. as a man walks with his friend (with whom he is well agreed, <hi>Amos</hi> 3. 3.) hand in hand, and heart in heart <hi>[aequis paſſibus]</hi> in equal pace and equipage. And this he did, not only for an hour, or a day, or a week, or a month, or a year, but for 300 years. Alas, we can neither watch with Chriſt,
<pb facs="tcp:93853:10"/>
nor walk [with] God for the ſpace of one ſingle hour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 40. The ſecond was the Walk of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who is bid to walk [before] God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 1; that is, to ſet himſelf [evermore] ſolemnly in Gods Preſence, as having the great God always in his Rear (his Lieutenant-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral) and for his rereward, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 52. 12. Thus the people of the God of <hi>Abraham</hi> had the cloudy pillar [behind] them in their paſſage through the red Sea, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. 19, 20. where <hi>Jehovah</hi> (himſelf) brought up the Rear of 600000. Now to know that you are ever under Gods eye, and ever before him, this muſt needs make you walk [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>] accurate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 15. and not to take up one foot, until you know where to ſet down the other, walking exactly, by line and by rule, and (as it were) in a frame footing it rightly and uprightly, (as the word [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>] ſignifies) <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 14. ſtriving to get to the very top of Godlineſs. The third was the Walk of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who were commanded to Walk [after] the Lord, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. 4. as after the Captain-General
<pb facs="tcp:93853:10"/>
of their ſalvation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 10. Thus the pillar of glory went before them through the wilderneſs, and they followed after it in all their removes, <hi>Exod.</hi> 13. 21, 22. Thus <hi>Caleb</hi> (with a better Spirit than that of the World) walk'd [after] God fully, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14. 24. as the needle doth, after the <hi>Load-ſtone</hi> that draws it, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 4. <hi>&amp; Joh.</hi> 6. 44. you walk after a good guide, while you walk after your good God, and in ſo doing you cannot eaſily wander in this wilderneſs of the World. This will be a bleſſed Antidote to you againſt curſed <hi>Apoſtacy.</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 17, 18. and thus God muſt be your [All] and [in All] <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 11. he muſt be [with] you, [before] you, and [behind] you alſo, that you may be as a Ship under Sail, carried end-ways, ſtrongly by a favourable Wind, and fearing neither Rocks nor Sands in the River of Gods Paradiſe. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 46. 4. <hi>&amp; Gen.</hi> 2. 10. to 15. This ſame [<gap reason="foreign">

               <pb facs="tcp:93853:11"/>
the true Spiritual Paradiſe of pleaſure, the ſublimeſt Spring-garden of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural-Holineſs, wherein you have not only pleaſant Rivers (as above) but alſo delightful walks far ſurpaſſing the beſt gardens and galleries that can be found in this <hi>(Chabul,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 9. 12, 13.) or dirty world. Herein you are directed, not to be Idle, nor to ſtand ſtill, but to go forward (as walkers do) and to walk Arm in Arm (as it were) not only with God, but with his holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, <hi>Zech.</hi> 3. 4, 5, 7. <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 30. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57. 2. And that not in one walk only, but in many Delectable walks whereof this bleſſed Paradiſe of Piety conſiſteth; inſomuch that as the laborious Bee in a fruitful field of fragrant Flowers (when Tyred with one Flower) flyeth to another; even ſo you, when wearied with one walk or duty (for you may be weary in it, when you are not weary of it) then may you paſs to another without nauſeating upon any one only; you may walk Orderly out of one Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance to another. Secondly, as to
<pb facs="tcp:93853:11"/>
your work, which is (as the walk) the beſt work in the World, though it be leaſt minded by the World; 'tis a work wherein you ſerve the moſt honourable Maſter, that employs his Servants in the moſt honourable work, and will reward them with the moſt honourable wages, to wit, with an hundred fold in this life, and in the world to come (again) with life ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, <hi>Mark.</hi> 10. 30. yea 'tis a work that is wages to it ſelf (as you will find within) <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. 11. In (as well as for) keeping Gods commands, there is great reward; 'Tis verily as the work of glorified Saints and of glorious Angels (it being of the ſame nature with theirs) whoſe work is their wages; O then, you may rationally conclude with your ſelf from hence, What a ſhame it is that I who am created to an Eternal being, and that do poſſeſs an Immortal Soul, ſhould ſpend 20. 30. 40. or 50. Years in Vanity (if not in Villany) all the time wearing the livery of a curſed Maſter (being a Slave to Sin
<pb facs="tcp:93853:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and <hi>Satan)</hi> and never look up to God, the beſt Maſter and the Supreme good. Alas, you may hop from Mountain to Hill, <hi>Jer.</hi> 50. 6. And go <hi>Satans</hi> round, <hi>Jab</hi> 1. 7. yet find no reſt (with <hi>Noah's</hi> Dove) for the Soles of the Feet of your Soul, until you come to the <hi>Ark</hi> of this bleſſed work: your Soul is Created with ſuch vaſt Capacities, as nothing bears proportion [either to 'its being, or to 'its wants] below God no Created being hath Room enough in it, to entertain ſo ample and ſo end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs a gueſt: 'tis of ſuch unlimited de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, that nothing but the Immortal God can ſatisfy an Immortal Soul.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Obſerve the method, which is firſt general, in the whole duty of Man to God, this is held out in thoſe three general Names. [1.] Of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. [2.] Of Religion. [3.] Of Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ianity. Together with the neceſſity of each: then Secondly, you have more particularly the many good duties of Man to God (both perſonal and rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive) Treated upon, and that with as
<pb facs="tcp:93853:12"/>
much perſpicuity and plainneſs as ſo little a Book would admit of: If you meet with any paſſage that ſeems ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, aſcribe it to the Curtnes of my ſtile [who indeavours to ſay much in a little] and after ſome acquaintance herewithal [with a little pondering] you will be able [through grace] to underſtand the darkeſt Sentence.

            <head>A Chriſtians Walk and Work on Earth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> CHAP. 1.</head>
            <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>OU muſt know that Man is the maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece of the Worlds' Maker. God calls (as it were) a Counſel in Heaven, ſaying, <hi>Let us make man,</hi> Gen. 1. 26, Us, all us, the whole Wiſdom of the Trinity was exercis'd in the making of Man: The conſultation and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration therein plainly demonſtrates, that there was then the bringing forth of a piece of work of greateſt moment and importance; and therefore what is ſaid of <hi>Behemoth, He is the chief of the ways of God,</hi> Job 40. 19. may more eminently be ſaid of Man; he is the chiefeſt of the ways and of the works of God. The Sun, Moon, and Stars are but the work of Gods fingers, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8. 3. But man is the work of his hands, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139. 14, 15. <hi>Job</hi> 10. 3. 8. Hence <hi>David</hi> ſpeaking of Man, firſt wonders,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:93853:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and then ſpeaks, and when he hath done to ſpeak, he hath not done to wonder, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8. 1. 9.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Every Creature of God is (indeed) a wonder, yea little Creatures (thoſe <hi>Decimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſexto's</hi> of the Creation) are great wonders, (as well as the great <hi>Behemoth,</hi> and other large <hi>Folio</hi>'s thereof) for the infinite Wiſdom and Power of the Creator is manifeſt in couch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up both life and motion in ſuch a little compaſs, as in Inſects, Flies, Ants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But Man is the greateſt wonder, as having the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of all other Creatures in him: he is the abridgment of all wonders. You believe that God is a Spirit, and you ſee that the World is a Body: Man is an Epitome of both, 1. Of God, in reſpect of his Spirit. And 2. of the World in the compoſition of his Body; as if the great <hi>Jehovah</hi> (on purpoſe to ſet forth a plain mirrous of himſelf and his work) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to bring into this one narrow compaſs of Man, both the infiniteneſs of his own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the vaſtneſs of the whole world all together.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The ſoul of Man reſembles the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of Heaven, as being everywhere over the little world: his brain the Sun that gives light to this little world, and the ſenſes ſtand round about it as ſo many Stars: His heart repreſents the Earth in its Center: his liver is as the Sea from whence flows the blood in all its circulations: the like correſpondency (you
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:93853:15"/>
may eaſily imagine) in all other parts too long to particularize. Hence is it that <hi>Tertullian</hi> calls the World a great Man, and Man a little world. Man (the Microcoſm) is Gods Text (as it were) and all other Creatures (in the Macrocoſm, or great world) are as ſo many plain Commentaries upon that dark Text.</p>
            <p n="4">4. You may learn a little further herein, (if you would have yet more particulars hereof) from this gloſs upon <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 15. <hi>Preach the Goſpel to every creature,</hi> is meant man only, as being the <hi>compendium</hi> of all Creatures. Stones have a being, but not life: Plants have a being and life, but not ſenſe: Beaſts have a being, life, and ſenſe, but they want underſtanding. Now Man (as being a compendious Index of Gods great Book in Folio) doth participate of a being with ſtones, of life with plants, of ſenſe with beaſts, and of underſtanding with Angels; and therefore is he moſt aptly called <hi>every creature,</hi> as having all their perfections in him.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Now the chief end why the Lord God put forth ſo much skill upon Man, in making him ſuch a curious piece, was, that Man ſhould ſerve his Maker. God raiſed up the ſtately Fabrick of the great World for Man (he did not bring Man into an empty houſe, but fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed it with all Creatures before he made him), and his maſter-piece <hi>Man</hi> he made for himſelf, and for his ſervice. This a Philoſopher had the right notion of, ſtileing Man the end
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93853:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of all in a Semi-circle, as all things were made for Man, and Man for God, and that Man might ſerve his Maker the better: he made him in his own likeneſs, that he might not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly partake of the Excellencies of all things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, but of the Image of his Maker above al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. Thus as one ſaid to his friend that deſired to ſee <hi>Athens, Viſo ſolone, vidiſti omnia,</hi> in ſeeing <hi>Solon,</hi> you ſee all; <hi>Athens</hi> was the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgment of all <hi>Greece,</hi> and <hi>Solon</hi> was the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of all <hi>Athens;</hi> ſo in ſeeing and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Man</hi> your ſelf, you ſee the quinteſſence of all things.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, <hi>That God made all things for himſelf,</hi> Prov. 16. 4, for ſerving his Glory, and well he may; For, firſt, he hath none a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove him, he is higher than the higheſt. And, ſecondly, he is not capable of being puffed up with vain-glory, as we ſhould be in ſuch a caſe. Now he that made all things for himſelf, muſt needs make Man for himſelf, ſeeing Man is the beſt of all things. Indeed 'tis the only end of Man's Creation, ſeeing no other Creature is capable of a Religious ſerving of God as Man is. All other Creatures do hold out the Power, Wiſdom, and Goodneſs of God; but Man on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly can hold forth the Holineſs of God, and he only (of all other Creatures) is commanded to be holy, as God is holy: he muſt be holy in quality, though he cannot be ſo holy in equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Seeing then it is the law of the Creature,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:93853:16"/>
that we ſhould be holy, and that we ſhould ſerve God inſtantly night and day, <hi>Act.</hi> 26. 7. Bethink your ſelf, how every Creature obſerves the Law of their Creation: The birds make their neſts, and breed up their young: the beaſts make a ſcuffle for their paſture and ſod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: the fiſhes float up and down the waters for their livelihood: the trees, herbs, and flowers, all anſwering their Makers Law in their kind: the fire aſcending up to its Center with all its might, and the water deſcending haſtily down into the deep: the air, to fill up all vacuity under Heaven: the Sun, Moon, and Stars fulfilling (each) their courſes aſſigned them.</p>
            <p n="8">8. How then can you imagine, that the great Creator (who hath aſſigned to every thing in the world ſome particular end, and an inſtinct alſo that have a tendency to that end, and that continually) ſhould make Man (the moſt noble Creature, for whom all other things were made) in vain, as having no peculiar end pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably appointed him to the true noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his created quality? Undoubtedly, he is not made to play on the Earth, as <hi>Leviathan</hi> was made to play in the Sea, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104. 26, nor to ſerve divers luſts, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 3, as debauched perſons do. The Heathen <hi>Seneca</hi> could ſay, <hi>Major ſum, &amp; ad majora natus ſum, quam ut corporis mei ſim mancipium;</hi> I am greater, and am born to greater things, then that I ſhould be a mere ſlave and vaſſalage to the luſts of my fleſh.</p>

Therefore you muſt conclude, that there is ſome high and eminent ſervice allotted unto Man by his Maker, as the main object where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at he is to level all his aims and intentions wholly and continually, even all the days of his life: he muſt ſerve his Maker <hi>in holineſs</hi> (which is his duty to the firſt Table of the Decalogue) <hi>and in righteouſneſs</hi> (which is his duty to the ſecond Table thereof) <hi>before him all the days of his life,</hi> Luk. 1. 74, 75. This is your Homage and Fealty you owe to your great Lord; the Lords Rent you muſt pay to the Landlord of all your Mercies, both as to your being, and as to your well-being in the world. There muſt be a Reciprocation betwixt Relatives, as the Son owes a duty to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, from whom he had his being, and from whom he hath all things for his well-being: How much more doth the Creature owe a duty to his Creator, who is his heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to whom we ſhould not be undutiful, as the worſt of parents would not have their Children undutiful to them?</p>
            <p n="10">10. It neceſſarily follows then, that you muſt <hi>avouch the Lord to be your God, and to walk in his ways, and to keep his ſtatutes, and his commandments, and his judgments, and to hearken to his voice:</hi> If ever you do expect that the Lord ſhould avouch you for one of his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and of his peculiar people, <hi>Deut.</hi> 26. 17, 18. Hebr. <hi>[Hee Marta eth Jehovah],</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies, that you muſt promiſe on your part (as
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93853:17"/>
your Maker hath promiſed on his part), there is a mutual ſtipulation on both ſides: you want not Gods part: <hi>And will a man rob God of his part?</hi> Mal. 3. 8. You do truly avouch the Lord for your God, when you with higheſt eſtimation, moſt vigorous affections, and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt endeavours, beſtow your ſelf upon him, and give up your name and heart to his bleſſed ſervice in faith and obedience, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 4. 4. 5. When God crys, <hi>Who is on my ſide? who?</hi> (as 2 <hi>King.</hi> 9. 32.) you muſt anſwer, I am the Lords, and ſubſcribe with your heart (as well as with your hand) unto the Lord, then may you hope for protection of him, and proviſion from him for both worlds, which be his part in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</p>
            <p n="11">11. 'Tis a plain command, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3 6. In all your ways you muſt acknowledg God, that is, be evermore in the ſenſe of his preſence, and in the light of his countenance, and in ſerving your God (in your generation-work) ask counſel at his mouth, and aim at his glory in all your undertakings. This is the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the whole matter (both to anſwer the end of your Creation, and to attain a true happineſs at your end), <hi>Fear God, and keep his Commandments,</hi> Eccleſ. 12. 13. This is the <hi>totum hominis,</hi> the whole duty of Man, the abridgment of all the Bible; <hi>Fear God in Chriſt, fear his goodneſs,</hi> Hoſ. 3. 5, as well as his power, and keep his Commandments in an Evangelical obedience (you cannot now keep them in the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:93853:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
legal way). This is the one thing needful, <hi>Luk.</hi> 10. 41, and 'tis the <hi>bonum hominis,</hi> the good of Man (as well as the whole of Man) <hi>to do juſtly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with his God,</hi> Mic. 6. 8. 'Tis not only the good, but alſo the chiefeſt good of Man attainable in this life; to wit, Conformity to God, and Communion with God in the Duties of the firſt and ſecond Tables of the Law.</p>
            <p n="12">12. This whole and good duty of Man to God, hath commonly three Names. 1. Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. 2. Godlineſs. 3. Chriſtianity. 1. 'Tis call'd Religion, <hi>[a Religando]</hi> from binding, as it is a ſacred bond that binds Man in his Duty to God. There is (indeed) the curſed bond of iniquity, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 23, which binds the heart of Man to Sin and Satan. But that may ſeem needleſs, ſeeing Man's heart doth ſo na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally love the ſervice of ſin; and you do not find your heart ſo apt to ſlip from the ſervice of Satan (ſo leſs need of this bond of iniquity), as you are apt to ſlip from the ſervice of God. As therefore you cannot love the ſervice of God, unleſs it be ſupernaturally given you; ſo a Religious principle muſt both bring you near to (who in the fallen nature are afar of, from God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 13.) <hi>Pſal</hi> 73. <hi>ult.</hi> But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo muſt bind your ſhppery heart faſt to God, that you may be Gods bundle, tyed up on Earth, to be carried up to Heaven. Religion is the girding up of the loins of your mind, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. 35. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 13: and he that is

thus ungirt, is certainly (according to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb) unbleſt alſo.</p>
            <p n="13">13. There is, 1. A Natural Religion where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Man faſhions his thoughts, words, and deeds according to the light and law of Nature; here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by alſo he hath a good or a bad opinion of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, according to the Conformity or Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to Natures light and law. And the more that the underſtanding of Man is enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, the ſtronger is the obligation (or bond) to all duties of this Natural Religion. But alas, ſuch darkneſs hath befallen the Gentile Natural Religion, that they have made Gods of men; and when they have ſo done, brings down thoſe Gods to play the men in murders, theſts, and rapes, as their own Poets are not aſhamed to tell us. 2. There is the <hi>Jewiſh-</hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which binds them to conform to all thoſe Laws (Moral, Judicial, and Ceremonial) and to obſerve them according to the intention of the lawgiver, and to judg of themſelves by their having or wanting Conformity to thoſe Laws. 3.

            <p n="15">15. (1) There is the <hi>Proteſtant-</hi>Religion, which truly abaſes Man, and exalts God. Thoſe be the two Properties of the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and ſuch as do not ſo, are always to be ſuſpected for falſe Religions. This laſt teaches us, that a man, being united by faith to Chriſt, believes in him both for Satisfaction and Salvation, though he come ſhort of Gods Glory and his own Duty, hoping to be ſaved by the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, and not by any Righteouſneſs of his own: It holds out recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilement to God, and communion with God as the end, and the Covenant of Grace as the means to that end. Thus doth it bind God and Man together after the great breach by
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:93853:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the fall; yea, it binds Man to God, after his breaking from God, and teaches him rightly to worſhip God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, according to the holy Scriptures.</p>
            <p n="16">16. There is but one true Religion that is binding to your ſoul: Diverſity of Religion is againſt the Eſſence of God, which is but one; there is but one Truth, one true Religion that hath life and power in it, all other are but carcaſſes, yea <hi>ſpectrum's</hi> and <hi>phantaſms.</hi> You muſt know, every difference in opinion makes not up a falſe and a differing Religion: Thoſe that agree together in fundamentals, cannot be ſaid to be of different Religions: there may be a ruffling the Fringe in circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials, where there is no rending the garment in ſubſtantials. <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Lot</hi> may take ſeveral ways, yet be brethren ſtill, yea, and be ready too to reſcue each other from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Enemy.</p>
            <p n="17">17. <hi>Plato</hi> bleſſed God for three things 1. That he was made a man, and not a beaſt. 2.

You may add to this God-bleſſing work, not only that you are born in a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of Religion (the land of <hi>Goſhen,</hi> and valley of Viſion), but that you are acquainted alſo with the power of it in your own heart: For, 1.

            <p n="18">18. Religion, to wit, in the power of it, gives both a Relative and a real worth to your ſelf in particular, as it gives beauty and ſafety to your Nation in General. 1. Real worth, it makes you of Gods treaſure, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. 5. of Gods jewels, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 17, whereof the world is not worthy, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 31.

there is great Reward, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. 11. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore look upon it as not only your duty but alſo your priviledg, not only your work but your reward too.

The plagues of the Lord fall upon thoſe that bring an evil report upon this good land, <hi>Numb.</hi> 13. 32. with 14. 37. The Apoſtle tells you that God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs is profitable unto all things.

            <p n="27">27. They bring up an evil Report upon this good land that ſlanderouſly ſay, Godlineſs doth beggar Men: whereas 'tis more truly ſaid that ungodlineſs doth begger Men. That this contrary is the truth; the Vales of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs are above the wages of wickedneſs, the gleanings of the former is above the whole Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the latter; do but look into the world and you may behold many fair Eſtates have been melted away by Whoredom, Idleneſs, Pride and Drunkenneſs. Such ungodly wretches are doubly undone by their own ungodlineſs, they are undone in this life, and undone in the life to come; while the little that a godly Man hath (by a ſpecial bleſſing of God upon his godlineſs) doth encreaſe to a thouſand, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. 16. <hi>Abraham, Job, David,</hi> and others were richer than any; and ſo might Men be now, If they could (or would) be as godly as they were. They ſought godlineſs and Gods Kingdom firſt, and therefore other things ſought them: and ſo they would do us, would we or could we but run the ſame me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod. They did not read Gods truth back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, making Earth their Throne and Heaven their footſtool, as the Heathens, Vertue after Money: <hi>Philoſophy</hi> teaches to ſeek firſt <hi>(bona Animi)</hi> the good of the Soul; and Divinity,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:93853:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>(Regnum Dei)</hi> the Kingdom of God; then the over-plus ſhall be added as the wiſe God Judges meet: the Proverb of blind <hi>Popery</hi> ſhall ſhame thoſe ſlaunderers, Meat and Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens never hinders thrift.</p>
            <p n="28">28. Another evil report upon godlineſs is, that it deſtroys all mirth, delight and pleaſure: alas Swine think that ſheep have no paſture, becauſe they feed not upon draff as they do. So the wicked World accounts godlineſs a Melancholy fancy; Whereas the way of it is a way of pleaſantneſs, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 17. And its paths are paved with peace: righteouſneſs hath not only peace, but alſo Joy in the holy Ghoſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 17. God doth not grudge nor envie our delights and pleaſures, only he would not have them ſenſual; he allows to have pleaſure, but he would not have us live in pleaſure, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5. 5. You may take delights, but delights may not take you: you may be merry, but you muſt not be mad, Mirth is not forbidden any further then is Inconſiſtent with your Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal good; Godlineſs doth not aboliſh it, but rectify it: <hi>Religio eſt loeta, non diſſoluta,</hi> 'tis a pleaſant not a looſe thing. God would not have our <hi>Iſaac</hi> (or laughter, or Joy, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light) to be ſacrificed; tis only the <hi>Ram</hi> that muſt be ſlain and offer'd up to God, thoſe rank and rammiſh delights in worldly vanity and villany <hi>(quorum gaudia Crimen habent)</hi> wherein the <hi>Devil</hi> is our play fellow.</p>
            <p n="29">
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:93853:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
29. The third evil Report Men bring up againſt godlineſs, is, that it ſhortens a Mans life by the practice of mortification, ſelf-denyal, and abſtinence from worldly comforts. <hi>Cujus contrarium Verum eſt.</hi> The quite contrary (you may be ſure) is the very truth, for 'tis not Piety but Impiety that ſhortens the life of Man. Temperance is the grand preſervative of health, and Intemperance is notoriouſly deſtructive to life, as the Book of nature teacheth you: moreover, the Book of Scripture further aſſures you, that length of days is promiſed to godlineſs. <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 30, 19, 20. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34. 12, 13, 14. <hi>Prov.</hi> 2. 21, 22. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3. 16, 22. 4. But the ungodly ſhall not live out half their days, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55. laſt. Nether can you think it probable that ſo good a Landlord as God is, ſhould thruſt thoſe Tenants out of their dwellings, that payeth their Rent ſo duly and daily: No, God will powre out his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation upon ſuch Perſons and Families as Call not upon his Name, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 10. 25. the non payment of this Lords Rent of prayer doth (as it were) uncover the Roof for Gods Curſe to be rained down upon Mens Tables, Beds, Enterprizes, All.</p>
            <p n="30">30. A fourth ſlaunder put upon Godlineſs, is that it makes Parents negligent and careleſs in providing for their Children: Whereas in truth, ſuch proviſion for Children as is not according to godlineſs, is (as <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaid to his
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:93853:27"/>
Mother) a laying up a Curſe for them, and not a bleſſing, how many ungodly Parents leaves <hi>Jobs</hi> Legacy to their Children, in laying up Iniquity for them (as well as Inheritances) <hi>Job.</hi> 21. 19, when God puniſhes the Sins of Fathers upon the Children, as 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. 29. <hi>Joab</hi> muſt have the honour of a General, with a Vengeance to him and his: And <hi>Gehazi</hi> muſt have ſeven hundred and fifty Pound to buy land withal, and with a Vengeance too to him and his, 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 5, 23, 27. And ſurely they are mad Parents that will damn their own Souls, in providing only for their Childrens bodies: on the other hand Godly Parents lay up a ſtock of prayers for their Children, of wraſtling with God, that no one Chip of the old blocks ſhould become ſewel to everlaſting burnings; and they are the Travel of ſome Mothers Souls, as they had been (at their births) the Travel of their bodies: beſides, the rule of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs teaches Parents to lay up for their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 14. <hi>Jacob</hi> could ſay, <hi>[and when ſhall I provide for my own Houſe alſo]</hi> Gen. 30. 30, and they are worſe than Infidels that do not, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 8, yet dare not turn ſtones into Bread, at the <hi>Devils</hi> bidding, for them, but what God gives, leaves it them with a bleſſing.</p>
            <p n="31">31. A fifth ſlaunder put upon it, is, that it looſeth friends: whereas indeed it gaineth Friends, making Enemies to become Friends,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:93853:27"/>
when your ways pleaſe the Lord. <hi>Prov.</hi> 16. 7, as <hi>Jacobs</hi> did, when <hi>Laban</hi> purſued him with one Troop, and <hi>Eſau</hi> affronted him with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; yet God ſo wrought for his godly Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, that he had peace with both, and a kiſs from both; you need not to fear Men, if you be in league with God.</p>
            <p>In a word, Godlineſs is <hi>(6ly.)</hi> ſlaundered, as <hi>the</hi> way to be deſpiſed, whereas riches and honor are in its left hand, <hi>Pro.</hi> 3. 16, as length of days (in eternal happineſs) is in her Right. Godlineſs may better ſay to us then <hi>Balak</hi> to <hi>Balaam,</hi> come and I will promote thee to great Honor this ſhould be a Cogent Argument. It did no leſs to <hi>Joſeph, David,</hi> &amp;c. Such as honour God (in ways of Godlineſs) God will (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly) honour them either here or here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after or both, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 30.</p>
            <p n="32">32. The third name that is uſually given to that ſervice which Man doth owe to God, (as his Servant,) is <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> which hath not only a reſpect to God the Creator, but alſo to Chriſt the Redeemer; it being a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Imitation of the Holineſs of Chriſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your power. This is that which muſt devote you and dedicate you to Chriſt, and make you Imitate the Holy life which your Lord did lead upon Earth: all that look for Salvation by Chriſt muſt purify themſelves as he is pure, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 3. you cannot be a Chriſtian, unleſs you comport and conform to
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:93853:28"/>
that Purity and Holineſs that was in Chriſt: you muſt learn of the Holy Child Jeſus, to be Holy in all manner of Converſation, and though you cannot take ſuch long ſtrides in ways of Holineſs as he did, though you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do what you ought, yet you ought to do what you can, (as 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28. 2.) Say you to God (as <hi>David</hi> to the King) thou ſhalt ſurely know what thy Servant can do: your Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs muſt be like to Chriſts in quality or kind, though it cannot be in (Equality) or Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
            <p n="33">33. This is that which gave the Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Name of Chriſtians firſt at <hi>Antioch,</hi> Act. 11. 26, which Name was given by Divine direction (as the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) ſignifies, warned of God. So the ſame word is Rendred, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 7. for the Divine Oracle had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to give a new Name to the Saints, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 62. 2. &amp; 65. 15. here it was accompliſhed, to wit, at <hi>Antioch,</hi> ſo much Honour had this City, that from thence Chriſt ſpreads his Banner, that it might appear to the World, that he had a people that would own him, and that would glory to be called by his Sacred Name, who were call'd <hi>Nazarens</hi> before, <hi>Act.</hi> 24. 5, which were certain Hereticks that jumbled Chriſt and <hi>Moſes</hi> together, Baptiſme and Circumciſion (as now ſome do the ſeventh day and the Lords day) to bring the greater diſgrace upon the Chriſtian Religion, <hi>Godwin
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:93853:28"/>
Hebr. Antiqu.</hi> Pag. 39, 40. Hence 'tis thought that the Church at <hi>Antioch,</hi> (being Divinely directed) in deteſtation of this New-bred Hereſy, (faſtened upon them by the Name of <hi>Nazarens)</hi> forſook that Name, and called themſelves Chriſtians. <hi>Junius</hi> in paralel. <hi>Lib.</hi> 1, 8.</p>
            <p n="34">34. Then was the partition-wall thrown down, and the dividing Names of <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile</hi> ended in this New and Honourable Name, which before was promiſed to <hi>Sion,</hi> as above. There was a Coalition of <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile</hi> into one Church, and (by Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence) an abrogation of the differing Names. Hence this common Name was given to both (believing in Chriſt) by God himſelf according to his promiſe; but Oh what a ſhameful thing it is, that this New and Honourable Name ſhould be at this day a Name of Reproach, amongſt the <hi>Papiſts</hi> in <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> by whom it is uſually abuſed to ſignify a fool or a dolt; as Dr. <hi>Eulke</hi> on <hi>Act.</hi> 11. in his <hi>Annotations</hi> upon the <hi>Rhem. Teſtam.)</hi> plainly proveth out of their own Authors: Thus thoſe ſame, who have changed Gods glory into their own ſhame (as to things) in their Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition and Idolatry, have done no leſs (as to Names) in their ignorance and debauchery, by a righteous Judgment of God upon them, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 11.</p>
            <p n="35">
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:93853:29"/>
35. But you muſt know that a Worthie Title is put upon you, an Honourable Name is given to you in your becoming and being a Chriſtian, (which ſignifies the Anointed of the Lord) even the ſacred Name of Chriſt (of whom the whole family in Heaven and Earth is named, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 15,) is called upon you: A name that will honour you, if you honour it, and that will highly exalt you, if you exalt it. <hi>Auſtin</hi> tells of one who had a Crown ſet upon his head, conſiſting indeed of many Crowns, (as he was an Emperour) yet he made not all this the Crown of his rejoycing; but prefer'd this as a greater Crown, that the name of Chriſt was called upon him; this he accounted his greater honor: and the Title to <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 118. ſhews you, that <hi>David</hi> accounted it a greater honour to be the ſervant of the Lord, than to be the King of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> The higheſt Title or name upon the Earth is nothing to this, no though it ſhould endure ſo long as the Earth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures, here's Eternity of Honour, and ſuch an Honour, as reaches from Earth to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
            <p n="36">36. The great difficulty you will find is to Anſwer this Name, to honour and exalt this Name, that it may honour and exalt you: 'tis an eaſy matter to be a Chriſtian in name, but to be a Chriſtian indeed there's the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty; to have our natures to Anſwer our
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:93853:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>
name (as to have ſelf to crucify ſelf) is no eaſy work, if you be but almoſt a Chriſtian, as <hi>Agrippa,</hi> you ſhall be but almoſt happy too. You will not find it eaſy to offer an holy vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence upon your ſelf, even to the plucking out of your right Eye, and the cutting off of your right Hand. Yet this you muſt do, if you will Anſwer your name, and be a Chriſtian (indeed) and enter in at the ſtrait gate by an holy violence, your heart is Weak, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 30, as well as your hand; and no leſs than the mighty hand of God can enable you for this mighty Work.</p>
            <p n="37">37. Therefore I muſt tell you, the Holy Scripture owns none to be Chriſtians but ſuch as be according to Chriſt, and as the Anointed of the Lord: there is a powerful influence in true Chriſtianity, that muſt ſpread it ſelf over three things. 1. Over your Conſcience, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 18, and therefore there muſt be the anſwer of a good Conſcience, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 21. 2. Over your Communication, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10. 20. your Tongue muſt be as choice Silver having a good Sound, by a tincture of the Spirit of Chriſt upon it. And 3. over your Converſation, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 1. you muſt be of a Chriſt-like Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation walking worthy of that high calling, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 13.</p>

            <head>Of a Religious, Godly and Chriſtian Converſation in the General. CHAP. II.</head>
            <p n="1">1. AS all thoſe three names aforeſaid, (to Wit, Religion, Godlineſs and Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity) do joyntly agree in this one great truth, that man muſt ſerve his Maker both in heart and life according to his revealed Will; not only in the harſher diſpenſation of <hi>Moſes</hi> (whoſe firſt Miracle was the turning water into blood) but alſo, and that eſpecially, in the ſweeter diſpenſation of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> whoſe firſt Miracle was, the turning of water into Wine, that cheers the heart of Man) and therefore Chriſtianity (the laſt of the three) doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in it the whole duty of Man to God; yea in the neareſt and deareſt Relation, to wit, in Chriſt: even ſo, the laſt of thoſe three (to which Chriſtianity communicates an effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual influence) to wit, converſation, may (in its Latitude) comprehend the concerns of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and communication alſo, as appears by the Sequel.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> tells you of <hi>(all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:93853:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of Converſation)</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 15, and of <hi>(all holy Converſation)</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 11. Thoſe two Expreſſions are extenſive, comprehending the whole duty of Man (Relating to God, to himſelf, and to others) in thought, word and deed; all converſation, and all manner of converſation. There is one converſation of your thoughts, another converſation of your words, and a third converſation of your deeds, and all reſpecting either your God, or your ſelf or others in wharſoever capacity or Relation you ſtand either in Church or World.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Touching your converſation in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral (before I deſcend into particulars) you muſt know it muſt be a worthy converſation, worthy of that ſacred name that is called upon you, the more unworthy that a Chriſtians converſation is, the greater pollution is caſt upon that Sacred name which is put upon him: the more Sacred his name is, the greater is his guilt, and the more accurſed. Such an one is the baſeſt of Men, and like a wither'd Vine good for no uſe, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 15. 4. Or like Unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vory Salt not ſo much as good for the dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 13. but to be trodden under foot.</p>
            <p n="4">4. 'Tis a good converſation that commends a Chriſtian, and that only: heart-ſervice doth (indeed) pleaſe God beſt, but never with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out life-ſervice too, which honours God moſt. <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 16, where the heart is made Suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:93853:31"/>
to Gods nature, there the life will be Subject to his Law. If Chriſt have his throne upon your Conſcience, his Scepter will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear upon your communication and upon your converſation alſo. Thus an holy converſation doth not only commend a Chriſtian before God, Angels and Men; but it alſo commends the God of the Chriſtians to the World; they glorify their Father, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 16. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 61. 9. <hi>Peil.</hi> 2. 15.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Beſides, your Chriſtian converſation muſt not only commend you for a Chriſtian, but it muſt prove you to be a Chriſtian. It would not be Miracles, if you could work them; nor <hi>Revelations;</hi> If you could be dignified with them; nor ſignes and wonders, if ſuch a power were given from above to you, that could (any or all, ſeverally or joyntly) prove you a Chriſtian: All thoſe have been given to workers of Iniquity, and ſuch as have caſt out <hi>Devils;</hi> have been caſt out to <hi>Devils</hi> (them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at laſt) as <hi>Judas</hi> who was a <hi>Devil</hi> (himſelf) <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 22, 23. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 2, 70. So then 'tis the converſation, which is all in all, and juſtifies before Men, yea and glorifies God too.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Our Lord ſaith thus of himſelf, if I do not the works of my Father, believe me not. <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 37, his works ſhould teſtify of him, what he was, <hi>Luk.</hi> 7. 20, 21, 22. His works muſt be the ſtandard by which they muſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:93853:31"/>
him, whether he were the Chriſt or no, and ſo a fit Foundation for their Faith: Chriſts <hi>Vicar,</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> (who cauſeleſly calls himſelf ſo) will not ſay thus as Chriſt ſaid; but will have all his precepts diſpatched not diſputed, obeyed, not examined (though we be bid to try the Spirits, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 1,) and although by his evil Example he drew thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands to <hi>Hell,</hi> yet none muſt ſay ſo much as what doſt thou?</p>
            <p n="7">7. Whereas works muſt be the ſtanding ſtandard, whereby all Men <hi>(as well as Chriſt)</hi> yea the <hi>Pope</hi> himſelf, muſt be meaſured, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be in Chriſt, and Chriſt in them. If you do not the works of Chriſt (to wit, ſuch as he hath propoſed for your Example; Imitable works) 'tis a vain belief, yea a mere conceit only to think your ſelf a Chriſtian, and you do but put an everlaſting cheat, upon your own Immortal Soul: your works tell the World, what you are, for thoſe the World ſees and hears, and by them you either glorifie your Father in Heaven, or give clear evidence, that you have denied the Lord, that bought you, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 1, and would Redeem you from a Vain Converſation. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 18, <hi>&amp;</hi> 2, 12.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Tis true, you may be a Chriſtian in truth though ſomething of Sin remain in your heart, yet then it muſt not be liked there, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 15. and although ſomething of Sin remain in your
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:93853:32"/>
life; yet then it muſt not Reign there, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 14. And for the main courſe of your life, you muſt be chaſt, modeſt, temperate, meek, gentle, kind, and pittiful. You muſt bridle your paſſions, mortifie your inordinate af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; and in a word, exerciſe all the graces of his Spirit in you and Godlineſs, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 7.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Your practice muſt be anſwerable to your profeſſion. You who carry Chriſts name <hi>(that Sacred worthy name)</hi> how exactly ſhould you carry your ſelf, and what manner of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ought you to be, 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 11, even a perſon to admiration (as the word <gap reason="foreign">

            <p n="1">1. HItherto of Converſation in General (which is the Practick part of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, Godlineſs, and Chriſtianity) now of a Religious, Godly, and Chriſtian Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation in particular (which is a large Field of diſcourſe.) You have here a breviary thereof contracted into a narrow compaſs; wherein you may View the whole Duty of Man to God, and Man in Reſpect of the Converſation; the <hi>Agenda,</hi> or things to be done, beſides the <hi>Credenda,</hi> or things to be believed. I told you before, there is the Converſation of your thoughts; as to that, I refer you to that Religious Duty of Meditation; which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth here, there is another Converſation of your Tongue, as to that, I refer you to that Religious Duty of Conference; which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth alſo in 'its place here. As to your Converſation in natural and civil Actions, (which is not my preſent Work) I refer you
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:93853:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to my Crown and glory of a Chriſtian from, <hi>Page</hi> the 78. to <hi>Page</hi> 121. Wherein you have directions to guide you therein.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Religious Duty in (the Walk of a Chriſtian) is therefore a comprehenſive Word, and contains in it the All of mans duty both to God and to Man: as the firſt Table in the <hi>Decalogue</hi> is before the ſecond Table. Firſt in Order, becauſe firſt in nature and Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency. I ſhall begin therefore with your duty to God in Religious Actions. And firſt with Meditation: which is a Scripture duty, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 8, that all the Sons and Daughters of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> ſhould live in the practice of: as <hi>Iſaac</hi> did, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24. 63, the heir of <hi>Abraham;</hi> you muſt walk in <hi>Abrahams</hi> (and in this Son of <hi>Abrahams)</hi> ſteps, in this World, If you would lodge in <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome (that <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonymon</hi> of Heaven) in the World to come: alas, thoſe licentious times have <hi>(almoſt) Antiquated,</hi> the power and practice of this Religious Duty, in which you ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant all your days. This holy Patriarch was not of ſo looſe a mind, as thoſe in our looſe times, that would ſpend the evening of the Sabbath in Sports and paſtimes, for he ſpent the Evening in holy Meditation.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Word <hi>[Shuach]</hi> in the <hi>Hebrew.</hi> Signifies to ſpeak with a low voice, as in the heart, and the Word in the <hi>Septuagins,</hi> [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>] Signifies a ſatiating Soliloquy;
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:93853:37"/>
as if <hi>Iſaac</hi> had his fill of Divine talking, both with his God, and with his own heart. It was his holy Exerciſe and Recreation (thinking the latter part of the day as fit for Acts of Holineſs as the former part was.) It was a pleaſant and delightful paſtime (as the <hi>Greek</hi> Verſion is) to the Patriarch, and he found more heart-Raviſhing complacency in it, then can be found in all the delights of the Sons of Men; and no leſs it was to the Prophet, who profeſſes he found more tranſcendent ſweetneſs in Meditating on the Word, then in the honey or in the honey-comb. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. 10. <hi>&amp;</hi> 94, 19. <hi>&amp;</hi> 139. 17. <hi>&amp;</hi> 119. 103. he found marrow and Gold, yea better in it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Oh then, do you account it your duty and your priviledg, to take a few turns daily upon this <hi>Mount Tabor</hi> of Divine Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation, which is an Heaven upon Earth, a beginning of the beatifical viſion, an Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (as it is in a manner without the body) plainly Angelical: 'tis an handſel of Happineſs and a Foretaſt of Heavenly Joy. Oh, who would not but be an <hi>Anchorite,</hi> to be pent up in the Voluntary Priſon-walls of this Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Action, and to ſay with <hi>Peter,</hi> 'tis good being here.

5. Objection, but you will ſay, how can ſuch a duty be ſo delightful, that is ſo difficult? to this I Anſwer, by <hi>Similies,</hi> difficulty and delight may be found in one and the ſame Action; there may be difficulty in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and delight in the progreſs and ending: the root may be Bitter, and the fruit Sweet. 1 <hi>Simile,</hi> 'Tis in this duty, as it is in the heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of an Oven, the firſt kindling of the fire in it may be not only difficult, but painful, the fewel muſt be ſet on fire; and then it muſt be blown up (with labour) into a Flame: after that the Oven begins well to warm, the fewel will then catch and kindle of it ſelf; no ſooner is a ſtick thrown into the Oven, but preſently 'tis all on a blaze: So where there is but a little ſparke of grace, in the heart at firſt, it requires ſome paines to blow it up into a Flame, but when the heart is once heated with the true Flames of Love, then doth it enflame all the thoughts, and ſets the affections on fire; inſomuch that then this duty will not only be without difficulty, but with much delight.</p>
            <p n="6">6. 2 <hi>Simile,</hi> 'Tis with your heart, as it is with that wax, which hath been laid in cold places, it thereby becomes hard and unpliable to your hand, inſomuch that it will break ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then bend: but if laid a while in the Sun or by the fire, or if wrought a while in your warm hand, then doth it ſoften and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:93853:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>
become pliable, and ſo capable of any Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion. Thus will it be with you in this Divine duty, the greateſt difficulty lyes in your entrance into it; for corrupt nature and carnal principles will put forth a repugnancy againſt it, and therefore fleſh muſt be put to ſilence in this bleſſed duty, which is (mainly) the exerciſe of the Spirit in you; the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of all ages tells you (as well as your own.) 3 <hi>Simile,</hi> that the entrance into <hi>Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> is attended with difficulties and diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; but when once the Nut-ſhell is crack'd, and the ſweetneſs of the Kernel taſted, then do youth paſs through all difficulties with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, till at laſt they become Famous Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in Church or State.</p>
            <p n="7">7. 4 <hi>Simile,</hi> This duty is <hi>(indeed)</hi> as the climbing upon ſome high Tree, <hi>Monument</hi> or <hi>Mountain,</hi> all hard Work; but then there is a bleſſed compenſation for all your paines at the top of all theſe. Firſt, at the top of this Tree of life, there be the choiceſt fruits to nouriſh up your Soul, to eternal life. Secondly, at the top of this <hi>Monument</hi> of mercy, you have the moſt lovely and Soul-refreſhing and heart raviſhing proſpect, even transforming and transfiguring you into the glory of it. Thirdly at the top of this <hi>Mountain</hi> of God, and of Holineſs you may behold not only the Kingdomes of this lower World and the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of them (quite contrary to the <hi>Devils</hi>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:93853:39"/>
land-skip ſhowed to your Lord) but alſo the glories of a better World <hi>(as Moſes from the Top of Piſgah)</hi> the upper land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> that tranſendently flows with <hi>Milk</hi> and <hi>Honey.</hi> Digging in Mines of the Earth; a preſſing of grapes in the Wine preſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Are both hard works; yet finding fine Gold in the Mines of the Scriptures by this Spiritual digging, and a rich Wine flowing from this bleſſed Wine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs of Divine Meditation, will make a ſatisfactory Amends for all your paines at laſt.</p>
            <p n="8">8 Having removed this Objection out of your way (as <hi>Amaſa</hi>'s body was out of the Armies way, that their March might not be hindred, 2 <hi>Sam</hi> 20. 12, 13.) Let us now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to ſhew as <hi>(Iſt.)</hi> how pleaſant this duty is; ſo <hi>(2ly.)</hi> how profitable both to your ſelf and to others. 1.

For preventing evil. <hi>Belzebub</hi> (that Prince of Flies) cannot Fly blow your heart ſo long as it is boiling a good matter, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. 1. <hi>(Hobr.)</hi> in Divine Meditation. Flies will not touch honey while it is Teething hot. 2 For promoting good, hereby you may obtain more familiar Acquaintance, with your God, and a more diſtinct underſtanding of your ſelf, both which are worth a Kingdom. <hi>2ly.</hi> 'Tis profitable to others, for Meditation makes a Man a full Man; it makes him accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed to ſerve out his Generation, and to be

            <p n="9">9. As this duty is pleaſant and profitable, So 'tis <hi>(3ly.)</hi> a neceſſary duty, as neceſſary as chewing the Cud is to beaſts of that kind: and as a due retaining of food is to man as well as beaſt, 'tis a general Obſervation that ſuch perſons, as do caſt up their meat by vomit, or caſt it out by ſtoole, as ſoon as they have eaten it, be always ill-thriven perſons; for though the ſtomack may catch hold of ſome ſmall parcel of the food; and thereby main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a life (ſuch as it is) for a time, yet is it no better then a life-leſs life, 'tis a life ſo filled with diſtempers, that it becomes a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to it ſelf; whereas when the food is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and a due fermentation is wrought in the Stomach, to a compleat concoction; then is nouriſhment Miniſtred, (as <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 19.) to all the parts, which makes a ſtrong, healthy and well-liking conſtitution.

            <p n="10">10. Meditation (as it is a pleaſant, profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, yea a moſt neceſſary, though much neglected duty) is two-fold, 1. Occaſional. 2. Appointed. Firſt occaſional, wherein all

occurrences of Temporal objects (occaſionally met with) affords you ſome Spiritual Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations: Note firſt, this requires a Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual heart, to make a Spiritual improvement of every Temporal object; that Divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence preſents to your Eyes, ears, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Senſes: <hi>David</hi> made a profitable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Heavens, crying, Lord what is man! <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8. and Chriſt at the Well of <hi>Shilo,</hi> (he who was <hi>Jacobs Shilo)</hi> ſpeaks there of the water of life, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. 10. <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 10. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A good heart makes every external object a Divine bleſſing: the Husbandmans plowing, ſowing and reaping, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Trades-mans buying and ſelling, his weighing and meaſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may afford you ſundry Spiritual inſtructions: And note ſecondly, If you gain no more by them, then a bare beholding of them with the Eye, the very brutes gain as much as you. If you content your ſelf with a bare natural uſe of the Creature without a Spiritual Improvement thereof, you get not the one half of that advantage by the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for which the Creator gave it you; the Beaſts of the field, and the Birds of the Air, have ſo much themſelves: you do not uſe the Creature, as Lord of the Creatures, ſo God made <hi>Adam.

Note the fifth, In a word, you may not be like the fooliſh Child, when you look on the Book of the Creature, only to behold the gawdy Pictures and Babies therein, or to gaze upon the gilded leaves, and cover there of; but you muſt mind your leſſon that every Creature doth eſpecially learn you: the <hi>Stork, Crane,</hi> and <hi>Swallow,</hi> know their Seaſons, <hi>Jer.</hi> 8. 7. the <hi>Ox</hi> knows his owner and the <hi>Aſs</hi> his Maſters <hi>Crib, Eſa.</hi> 1. 3. and will not you learn from hence to know yours?</p>
            <p n="13">13. As to your further improvement of the Book of nature (with 'its 3. leaves of Heaven, Earth, and Sea) I refer you to my Crown and glory of a Chriſtian. From <hi>Page</hi> 125. to 145. I now paſs from occaſional to Appointed Meditation, which is, the Souls ſetting of it's ſelf apart, ſilently and ſeriouſly to work out ſome profitable Meditations, upon ſome choſen Subject (out of its own heart) throughly, at
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:93853:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>
a fit time and in a fit place; thus <hi>Iſaac</hi> went out into the field to Meditate (as above) <hi>Gen.</hi> 24. 63. That which concerns matter of knowledg, for finding out truth, doth chiefly belong to Students, Schollars, Miniſters of the Goſpel; but matters of affection for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flaming our loves to God in Chriſt, and for abaſing our ſelves to a ſelf-abhorrency, this is of Univerſal concernment, the work of every Chriſtian.</p>
            <p n="14">14. This bleſſed duty hath 'its beginning in the head, but 'its ending in the heart. (1.) 'Tis a pondering ſome Divine truth in your mind, until you be well acquainted with it, until you be ſeaſoned with the Savour of it, until it ſettle and take rooting in your Spirit, until it beget in you good affections, and fire your Soul in love to that truth. (2.) 'Tis like the rubbing of a Man in a Swoon, it (as it were) chaſes in the Oile of grace with a warm hand or rather, with a warm heart. (3.) 'Tis like the ſelvedge that keeps all the looſe threeds from ravelling out. (4.) 'Tis as the hammer that drives the nail of Divine truth to the very head. (5.) 'Tis as the Art of the <hi>Bee</hi> ſucking <hi>Honey</hi> out of Flowers; then in your Soul a Spiritual <hi>Deborah,</hi> (which in <hi>Hebrew</hi> ſignifies a <hi>Bee)</hi> when it gathers the ſweetneſs of many Spiritual Flowers, and then works it up in the <hi>Hive</hi> of the hidden Man of the heart. (Laſtly) Meditation doth
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:93853:42" rendition="simple:additions"/>
(after a ſort) transform you into the Image of truth (as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 18.) making truth one with you, and you one with it, and turning all you hear and Read into Juice and blood by a kindly digeſtion.</p>
            <p n="15">15 That you may manage this Meditation the better, and make work of your work; you muſt conſider there be three main ſteps herein, to wit, 1. Ingreſs. 2 Progreſs. 3. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs: the firſt ſtep is the hardeſt, (as is ſhewn above, <hi>Paragraph.</hi> 5. 6. 7.) therefore take thoſe two grand Rules of Direction about your Ingreſs. (1. Your heart muſt be prepared. (2.) your ſubject muſt be profitable: as to the firſt you muſt pray your heart into a Meditating frame, a praying heart is the beſt Meditating heart; and a Meditating heart is the beſt praying heart, thoſe two twin duties (like the City buildings ſhore up and ſuccour each the other. It is ſaid of <hi>Gerſom,</hi> that he hath ſometimes ſpent four houres in baniſhing bad thoughts, and in working up his heart into Tune for this Angelical duty. You may not begin this duty with a Raw and a cold (but always with a warm) heart: 'Tis a Rule in Phyſick; <hi>[Medicandum eſt cum coctis, non cum crudis,]</hi> Your thoughts will be Raw, till they be boiled in a warm heart, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. 1. And raw Meditations have no heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Vertue in them to a Sin-Sick-Soul.</p>
            <p n="16">
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:93853:42"/>
16. When you have (through Divine aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance) prepared (in ſome meaſure) your heart; then ſecondly, make choice of ſome profiting Subject, ſuch as may edify your Soul: you muſt not come to the buſh (which the Lord is in the midſt of) with your ſhoes of Worldly-mindedneſs upon you. <hi>Exod.</hi> 3. 5. When you go up to <hi>Mount-Moriah</hi> with your offering you muſt (with Holy <hi>Abraham)</hi> leave the Servants and the <hi>Aſs</hi> at the foot of the Hill, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. 5. When you are (with <hi>Moſes)</hi> to aſcend this <hi>Mount</hi> of Meditation] the Law is peremptory, [the beaſt that touches the <hi>Mount</hi> ſhall ſurely die.] <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. 12, 13. you muſt be better then a beaſt, and more then a Man, yea you had need be an Angel for this Angelical work.</p>
            <p n="17">17 At your Ingreſs (or entrance) into this duty, you will find earthly thoughts to proffer themſelves, and preſs upon you with Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, but Heavenly thoughts muſt with Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity be ſued for and ſought after. When you would think of Heaven and Heavenly things then will you thoughts of Earthly things lay Ambuſhments in your way, and Intercept you: thoſe Birds, that have their Wings daubed with Bird-lime, cannot Flie, much leſs mount up towards Heaven: you may not be like <hi>Martha,</hi> who was cumbred about many things, but (with <hi>Mary)</hi> you muſt chuſe the better part for the Subject of
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:93853:43"/>
your Meditation: you may not be as the <hi>(Scarabeus</hi> or) Horſe flie, that paſſes over a whole field of Flowers, and at laſt lights upon ſome filthy dung: you muſt rather be [a <hi>Deborah]</hi> a Divine <hi>Bee</hi> (as above) that flies over the dung with abhorrency, and fixes upon the moſt fragrant Flowers, or as the Noble <hi>Hawk</hi> in her flight, that paſſeth over <hi>Crows</hi> and <hi>Jack-daws</hi> (as unworthy of her purſuit) and falls upon Birds of better prey.</p>
            <p n="18">18. If yet worldly thoughts hinder your entrance upon your work, you muſt pray them away as <hi>Abraham</hi> did the fowles that trouble him in his Sacrifice, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 11. And though they be thoughts, that are need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful enough (as how to care for your Family) at another time, yet muſt you then ſay to them as <hi>Huſhai</hi> ſaid of the Counſel of <hi>Achitophel,</hi> 'tis not good at this time, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17. 7. Family-cares have their proper Seaſon, but at this time they are unſeaſonable: Suppoſe yet further that ſeveral good thoughts do come together into your mind at once, know that this may hinder your entrance (through the wiles of <hi>Satan)</hi> alſo, as when a great many people crowd in at a door all at once, they all Stick faſt and none can enter; In this caſe you muſt ſingle out from the reſt, your ſelected Subject that it may paſs alone, without crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and reſerve the reſt to come ſingly on in their proper place and Seaſon.</p>
            <p n="19">
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:93853:43"/>
19. Your ſelected Subject muſt be either ſomething concerning God, or ſomething concerning your ſelf: Firſt concerning God, either his works or his word. 1. Meditate on the works of God, not only on ſuch as are common to the World (ſuch as Creation and providence be) but alſo on ſuch as are proper and peculiar to his Church and Children. We have thought on thy loving kindneſs, (ſaith the Church) <hi>Pſal.</hi> 48. 9. (we have ſilently muſed. <hi>Hebr.)</hi> it being better admired then expreſſed. So muſt you muſe on Gods love to your Soul, (1.) on his electing love, O think with your Self, ſhould not you give God a room in your heart at this time, who gave you a room in his heart before times, even from all Eternity, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 11. <hi>(2ly.)</hi> on his redeeming love, think then how God beſtows Chriſt (the beſt of all things) even on you the worſt of all things) for you know more evil to your ſelf, then to all the World beſide: think alſo, O this ſurpaſſing love of God in beſtowing a Chriſt on you, and not on others, that (for ought you know) better deſerved him, and (poſſibly) might have made a better Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of him. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 22.</p>
            <p n="20">20. And thirdly Meditate upon Sanctifying love, O wonderful condeſcenſion that ever the Spirit of Holineſs, ſhould vouchſafe to dwell in ſuch a dirty dog-hole as your defiled Soul, and that an Houſe of unclean Spirits,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:93853:44"/>
(it may be, a whole <hi>Legion</hi> of them, for as <hi>Luther</hi> ſaith, <hi>tot doemonia, quot crimina,</hi> So many Sins, ſo many <hi>Devils.)</hi> Should ever become the Temple of the Holy Ghoſt; And thus may you Meditate alſo upon Juſtifying love. Fourthly, which is ſuch an Act of Divine grace, as is equally vouchſafed to the weakeſt (if true) as to the ſtrongeſt Saint, to poor you (if a Chriſtian in truth) as well as to great <hi>Paul</hi> or to the bleſſed <hi>Virgin:</hi> and eternity ſhall not add to the matter of it, though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it may to the manner of it. Fifthly, upon Adopting-love, which makes Sons and Daughters of Children of the <hi>Devil,</hi> as well as of wrath, and gives a leaſe of the beſt Inheritance, not only for three lives, yea not only for a thouſand years, but for eternity, even for ever and ever.</p>
            <p n="21">21. Laſtly upon glorifying-love, whereof indeed you are not Capable, in this life. <hi>Peter</hi> got but a glimpſe of it at Chriſts transfigur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and he was plainly intoxicated with it, ſo that he wiſt not what he ſaid, <hi>Matth.</hi> 17. 5. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> O admire, that you (a worthleſs worm and wretch) ſhould hereby become not only, [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>] like Angels, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. 30. but even advanced above Angels, for glorifyed Saints are Sons of the Kingdom, when glorious Angels ſtand by, as ſervants. In a word, all theſe love-tokens are ſuch tranſcendent privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, that they can never be enough thought
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:93853:44"/>
on and admired; no, though you ſhould think upon nothing elſe, and that ſo long as your life ſhall laſt, yea though you ſhould live as long as the World ſhall laſt; and therefore God hath appointed an Eternity, in a better World, where you ſhall have no other Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, but to ponder them and to praiſe God for them; Singing <hi>Hallelujahs</hi> to him that ſits upon the Throne for evermore.</p>
            <p n="22">22. As you muſt thus Meditate on Gods works, ſo ſecondly upon his word; whether precepts, or preſidents, or promiſes, or Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances thereof: all which have ſweet <hi>Honey</hi> in them, to the Divine <hi>Bee:</hi> Your ſecond Subject is concerning your ſelf, as <hi>David</hi> did when he Eat in his Pallace. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 14. Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with an humble heart <hi>(Lord what am I?)</hi> Not, <hi>what am I not?</hi> As <hi>Nebuchadnozzar</hi> did, with an haughty Spirit, as he ſat in his palace, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4. 29, 30. Humble <hi>David</hi> who had neither an haughty heart, nor a lofty Eye, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 131. 1, 2. hath exceeding high thoughts of God, and exceeding low thoughts of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he cannot name any thing bad enough to compare himſelf unto; in his <hi>(Lord what am I?</hi> he ſaith not, Lord, what a great <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch</hi> am I? Or what a great Man am I? But he ſaith I am a worm and no Man, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. 6. I am a dead-dog, or a Flea, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 14. Lord what am I? O Imitate this Holy <hi>David,</hi> as you ſit in your Houſe! I am the leaſt of
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:93853:45" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Saints and greateſt of Sinners. <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 8. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 15. But take heed of <hi>Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zers</hi> ſelf admiration, who Trumpets out his own glory when none asked him the Queſtion; as if he had done all (whereas <hi>Babylon</hi> was built above a thouſand years before he was born) and God that builds all Cities. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 127. 1. had done nothing, God is not in all his thoughts, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10. 4. he exalts ſelf and excludes God.</p>
            <p n="23">23. Your ſecond ſtep herein is progreſs, which is more eaſy then the firſt. As a Bird hath the greateſt lift, when ſhe riſes up from off the Earth, but when once got upon the Wing, then ſhe mounts up aloft, not only without much ſtraining difficulty, but with much ſporting complacency; then doth ſhe ſing out her Melodious note throughly, ſo long as ſhe liſteth and liketh, as (likewiſe) a Ship hath always the moſt difficulty to hale out of Harbour (where many times ſhe ſtick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth faſt in the <hi>Mud)</hi> but if once got under Sail and a freſh gale of wind ſitting right for her, O how ſhe ſports in the waters (as the Bird doth in the Air) and goes on gallantly towards her deſired Haven; yea even in a ſtormy and tempeſtuous Sea, let her have but Sea-room enough, and then ſhe feares not to be driven by the ſtorm, either upon Rocks or Quick-Sands: as 'tis thus with Birds, Ships ſo with Bells, 'tis hard to get them up;
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:93853:45"/>
when once raiſed then rung with eaſe and delight, juſt ſo it is with your Soul in this Divine work, all your difficulty is to get up from the low Earth upon the wing (with the Bird of the Air) and to get out of the mud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy harbour (with the Ship of the Sea) under Sail, if once ſet a float and forward bound under a freſh gale of the Spirit of grace; O how merrily do you mount upwards (with the Bird) and how gallantly do you go end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways towards the Cape of good hope (with the Ship) ſo that an entrance is adminiſtred unto you abundantly into the Heavenly Kingdom, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 11. <hi>as it were, with Colours flying, Drums beating, Trumpets Sounding, yea with top and top Gallant entring into your Maſters joy,</hi> Matth. 25. 21, 32.</p>
            <p n="24">24. For furthering your Progreſs, take theſe ſhort directions. 1. <hi>Direct.</hi> when you have turn'd (what you ſhould not think on) out of doors (as <hi>Sarah</hi> did <hi>Hagar)</hi> and taken in what is neceſſary, expedient and profitable for you to Meditate upon, then in Gods ſtrength, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 71. 16. you muſt view your Subject round about and obſerve all it's cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances as well as it's ſubſtance; thus the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> counſels you (that you may think the better upon the loving-kindneſs of God in the midſt of the Temple) to walk round about <hi>Sion;</hi> and tell the Towers of it, and mark well her bulwarks, yea conſider her
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:93853:46" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Palaces, <hi>&amp;c. Pſal.</hi> 48. 9, 12, 13. Until you fully and diſtinctly know all. 2. <hi>Direct.</hi> Then you muſt dwell upon it with your doubled and redoubled thoughts, and fix your Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, pondering it in your mind; until it have a kindly influence upon your affections, until it become a Rooted and Engrafted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration: Mountains are barren, becauſe the Rain of Heaven run's off from them; but valleys are fruitful, becauſe it reſteth there, the Wolf greedily ſwallows his meat (hair and all) ſo all goes from him into excrements, he preſently voids all, ſo makes all void and never fatteneth. 3. <hi>Direct.</hi> Retain therefore your Subject and duty till you find ſomething of God in it, dropping down upon your heart, till you find <hi>Elijahs</hi> God in <hi>Elijahs</hi> mantle working wonders for you. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 2. 14. Let neither go without advantage. 4. <hi>Direct.</hi> When you have found God (in your Subject and duty) retain him ſome while, as <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> did the Lord Chriſt. <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 3, 4, 5. ſaying, paſs not away I pray thee from thy Servant, but reſt with me for a while, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> O then are you an happy Son or Daughter of <hi>Abraham,</hi> when you can thus engage the Lords ſtay with you in this Divine duty. 5. <hi>Direct.</hi> Forget not to retain your own ſlippery heart, 'twil linger as <hi>Lot</hi> in <hi>Sodom.</hi> If the Lord of Angels help you not. <hi>Gen.</hi> 19 16. be oft crying; O quicken this loitering heart,

            <p n="25">25. Your third ſtep is Egreſs; when you have (through grace) brought your Divine duty to ſome profitable Iſſue, then (1.) take down your Soul by degrees, and not all on the ſudden: 'tis a dead Bird that falls down like a ſtone without hovering upon the wing, as the living ones do: as nature cannot endure any ſudden alteration, ſo nor grace <hi>(Deus &amp; Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura non faciunt ſaltum)</hi> God and Nature make no leaps.

Firſt, as it gives God the glory of his three great Attributes. 1. It gives him the glory of his Omniſciency, that he knows all your wants, that he, whoſe Throne is in Heaven, yet hears all your Petitions preſented to him upon Earth. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8. 30. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 7. 14. yea when you pray only heart prayer (which man heareth not, knoweth not) as <hi>Moſes,</hi> Exod. 14. 15.

It can do more then all the <hi>Witches</hi> in the World can do, for it can ſet God at work, whereas they can but ſet the <hi>Devil</hi> at work; none knows what Prayer can do, but thoſe that know what God can do; in this ſenſe, Prayer is ſaid to be Omnipotent as it ſets Omnipotency at work: it hath had command over all the four Elements, as <hi>1ſt.</hi> Over the Air in <hi>Elijah.</hi> Jam. 5. 17. to whom God gave this Key to open and ſhut up Heaven at his pleaſure. <hi>2ly.</hi> Over the fire which the ſame <hi>Elijah</hi> fetchs down at pleaſure by his Prayer one time in a way of wrath, 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 1. 16. and another time in way of mercy and merciful acceptance. 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 18. 37, 38. <hi>3ly.</hi> Over the water in <hi>Moſes.</hi> Exod. 14. 15, 16. And <hi>4ly.</hi> Over the Earth in the ſame Man of God, who by his powerful Prayer; firſt cleaves the Sea aſunder to ſave <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and then the Earth aſunder to deſtroy the complices of <hi>Korah,</hi> Numb. 16. 29, <hi>&amp;c. Pſal.</hi> 106. 17.
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:93853:48"/>
As thoſe two great conſorts of Chriſt on <hi>Mount Tabour (Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> Math. 17. 3.) had command over the four <hi>Elements:</hi> So <hi>Joſhuah</hi> over the Sun it ſelf. <hi>Joſh.</hi> 10. 12. as by <hi>Moſes</hi> Prayer, he had command over <hi>Amalek</hi> before. <hi>Exod.</hi> 17. 11, 12. Yet higher, <hi>Eliſhah</hi> by Prayer hath command over the Angels, fetching them out of Heaven, for his Protection and comfort. 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 6. 17. but yet higher than that over god-man, the Angel of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> the Lord of Angels in <hi>Jacob. Gen.</hi> 32. 24, 25, 26. Who (as <hi>Sckindler</hi> Interprets. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 12. 4. <hi>Bacah)</hi> wept and Supplicated <hi>Jacob,</hi> ſaying let me go for the day dawneth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 25.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Lord Chriſt (there) askes him his Name, as if he had ſaid, thou art ſuch a fellow as I never met withal, and therefore he confers the honour of Knight-hood (as it were) upon him in ſaying to him, kneel down <hi>Jacob,</hi> riſe up <hi>Iſrael;</hi> having power with God and prevailing. Thus alſo the Lord Chriſt was overcome, by the power of the <hi>Canaanitiſh</hi> womans Prayer of Faith. <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. 26, 28. Inſomuch that he gives her the Key of his Treaſury, and bids her go in and take what mercy ſhe pleaſed, he turns her looſe (as it were) into his fullneſs and all ſufficiency; and not only his own Omnipotency is at her beck, but alſo <hi>Devils</hi> and all muſt ſtoop to her, if ſhe pleaſed; O woman great is thy Faith
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:93853:49"/>
(in Prayer) be it unto thee even as thou wilt. You muſt know, How <hi>Jacob</hi> (as this <hi>Syro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaenician</hi> woman) outwreſtled Chriſt, for 'twas his wonderful condeſcenſion to put forth more of hiw own ſtrength in <hi>Jacob</hi> againſt himſelf, then he did in himſelf againſt <hi>Jacob.</hi> This redeeming Angel (as <hi>Jacob</hi> calls him <hi>Gen.</hi> 48. 16.) held him up with one hand, as he ſtrove againſt him with the other, and voluntarily yeilded himſelf as conquered by the <hi>Patriarch</hi>'s Prayer; otherwiſe the ſame Divine power that disjointed <hi>Jacobs</hi> thigh, could as eaſily have unclaſped his hands. O how can you but admire this glorious vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafement!</p>
            <p n="5">5. Laſtly, God himſelf ſpeaketh as if his hands had been tyed up by Prayer. <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 10. Let me alone, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As if <hi>Moſes</hi> had held him from his purpoſe, and had laid fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and reſtraints upon Omnipotency, and (as <hi>Auſtin</hi> gloſſeth upon the place) brings the Almighty to beſpeak his own freedom, yea indenting with <hi>Moſes,</hi> and offering him a Compoſition for [his] ſilence and his own liberty, ſaying, (if ſo) I will make of thee a great people, as if <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Devotion had been ſtronger then Gods Indignation: which ſhews, that great is the power of Prayer, 'tis able after a ſort (Fifthly another gloſs) to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuſe a dead Palſy into the hands of Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency; this cannot be through the prevalency
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:93853:49"/>
of Human power againſt Divine, but through the condeſcenſion of Divine grace to poor Mortals, bidding us, concerning the work of his hands to command him. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45. 11. Which is a wonderful expreſſion, rather to be admired with an holy Reverence, then ſtrained into a rude blaſphemy: undoubtedly it would be no leſs then black blaſphemy in us to ſay ſo, had not God himſelf ſaid it for us, and <hi>Gen.</hi> 19. 22.</p>
            <p n="6">6. All this ſhews you both the excellency, and the efficacy of right Prayer; the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> tells you, it avails much. <hi>Jam.</hi> 5. 16. Yet doth not tell you how much, you muſt find out that both by your own experience and by the Experiences of others. It certainly availeth [much,] though happily it availe not [always] God hath indeed ſaid that the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Moab</hi> ſhall go into his Sanctuary to pray: but ſhall not prevail. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 16. 12. But he hath avowed before all the world that the Children of <hi>Sion</hi> ſhall not do ſo. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45. 19. They ſhall not ſeek the Lord in vain: their Prayer ſhall be like <hi>Jonathans</hi> bow, it ſhall never return empty.

7. Firſt the manner of Prayer; Now that your Prayer may be [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>] a throughly-wrought, effectual and available Prayer, to work wonders in Heaven and Earth. <hi>Jam.</hi> 5. 16. yea after a ſort Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent as <hi>Luther</hi> ſaid; take theſe following Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections for managing this duty aright, firſt before duty, as to the manner of it before, in, and after it. Firſt of thoſe that are Antecedent or before Prayer. <hi>Direct.</hi> 1. You muſt be New born, a New Creature; until the Child be come out of the womb, it cannot Cry, no more can you Cry <hi>Abba</hi> Father, ſo long as you are in the womb of a natural ſtate, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 15. God firſt accepts the perſon, and then the Action or offering. <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 4. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 4. your perſon muſt be accepted as <hi>Abel</hi> was, and then your Prayer will be acceptable, you muſt be Righteous (in Chriſt) 'tis the Prayer of the Righteous that prevaileth, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5. 16. as it is the Character of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous, that they call not upon God, <hi>Pſal. 14. 4. Paul was never ſaid to pray till Converted from his Phariſaical State.</hi> Act. 9. 11. So if at any time they do pray, their Prayer is an Abomination. <hi>Prov.</hi> 21. 27. and therefore 'tis not accounted Prayer. The long Prayers that <hi>Paul</hi> had while a <hi>Phariſee</hi> were not reckoned Prayer at all: you muſt firſt be a Temple of the Holy-Ghoſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 19. and then you will be an Houſe of Prayer:
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:93853:50" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for ſo the Temple is called. <hi>Naturaliſts</hi> tell us of a <hi>Jewel,</hi> that, when put into a dead mans Mouth, loſeth all its Vertue: So prayer (a pretious <hi>Jewel</hi> in it ſelf) in the mouth of one that is dead in Sin, hath no force, nor efficacy: <hi>God will not hear Sinners,</hi> Joh. 9. 31. he will not take them by the hand, <hi>Job.</hi> 8. 20. Margin <hi>Hebr.</hi> and <hi>Geneva Biblt,</hi> 'tis but a Multiplying lies daily, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11. 12. a compaſſing God with lies to call God Father when we are not his Children, and while we are without Chriſt. You muſt paſs through the merits of the Son, into the mercies of the Father.</p>
            <p n="8">8. The ſecond <hi>Direction</hi> before duty is, prepare to meet your God in duty. <hi>Amos</hi> 4. 12. The <hi>Jews</hi> had their preparation for the <hi>Paſſeover.</hi> Joh. 19. 31. So ſhould you have for prayer, ſetting ſome time apart as well to prepare for Prayer, as for prayer it ſelf; 'tis coming to duty with a common Spirit, and with an Ordinary frame of heart, that makes us loſe many a duty. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 12. 14. <hi>Ezra</hi> did better then <hi>Rehoboam</hi> herein, <hi>Ezr.</hi> 7. 10. the latter loſt all, the former ſav'd all hereby. Labour therefore your heart into a praying frame before prayer; this is done by getting. Firſt, the Majeſty of the great God (before whom you are going) wrought truly and throughly upon your heart. Conſider ſeriouſly he is a great King. <hi>Mal.</hi>

1. 6, 14. and a God that will be Sanctified of all that draw nigh to him, <hi>Levit.</hi> 10. 3. this may help you to a God ſanctiſying, frame of Spirit: <hi>David</hi> prepared with all his might, why? the reaſon is rendred. The Temple was not to entertain man but God, therefore muſt it be more Magnificent and he more exact in all preparations for it. 1 <hi>Chro.</hi> 29. 1, 2. Chriſt tells you, he is gone to prepare a place (even a Temple, a <hi>Manſion</hi> of glory) for you, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 2, 3. and will not you prepare a place for him in that poor heart of yours? Conſider alſo, Secondly, his purity, that the God (with whom you have to do in prayer) is a God of purer eyes then to behold Iniquity, <hi>Hab.</hi> 1. 13. he cannot look upon it, but he muſt loath it; he cannot behold it, but he muſt puniſh it; this calls for a reverential heart, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 11. Before him who is in Heaven and you on Earth, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5. 2. cover your face, if Angels do ſo that are holy and bleſſed, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 6. 2. Much more you that live in an Houſe of clay, and drinks up iniquity like water, <hi>Job</hi> 4. 19. <hi>&amp;</hi> 15. 16. Tremble to bring along with you any Sin unrepented of, unpardoned, lay aſide all filthineſs; <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 21. as the Serpent her poiſon when ſhe goes to drink, yet with this difference, ſhe after drinking reaſſumes it again, you may not do ſo with the Poiſon of Sin, when you have been drinking of the Rivers of Gods favour, this
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:93853:51" rendition="simple:additions"/>
is to return with the Dog to his Vomit. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 22. you muſt know it again no more. <hi>Gen.</hi> 38. 26. nor have ſo much as a leering look towards it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66. 18. much leſs allow of it or wallow in it.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Would you have leave with God in prayer, then leave Sin and that for ever; you may not ſay concerning your Sins as <hi>Abraham</hi> did concerning his Servants, and the Aſs <hi>(which he left at the foot of the Hill, Gen.</hi> 22. 5.) ſaying, <hi>I will come again to you;</hi> but you muſt take an everlaſting farewel, of your Sin when you come to your God, and with <hi>David</hi> keep your ſelf (for ever) from your Iniquity. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18. 23. and as he waſh'd his hands in Innocency, when he did compaſs Gods Altar. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 26. 6. So muſt you waſh your heart in that fountain that is opened, <hi>Zech.</hi> 13. 1. Thus <hi>Ruth</hi> did waſh and anoint her ſelf before ſhe went up to <hi>Boaz.</hi> Ruth. 3. 3. and <hi>Eſther</hi> purified and perſumed her ſelf for acceptance with <hi>Ahaſuerus.</hi> Eſth. 2. 9, 12. <hi>and the Captive</hi> Damoſel <hi>was to pair her nails,</hi> &amp;c. Before ſhe became a fit bride for an <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elitiſh</hi> Bed, <hi>Deut.</hi> 21. 12, 13, 14. and the <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies</hi> ſay, that a Man might not come into the Mountain of the Houſe of God with his ſtaff, nor with his Shoos, nor with his purſe, nor with duſt upon his Feet; hence <hi>Lavers</hi> were ſet at the door of the <hi>Tabarnacle,</hi> for waſhing off defilements at their entrance thither;

               <hi>Exod.</hi> 30. 18, 19. and <hi>Bernard</hi> uſed to ſay at his entrance to his publick Devotion, O word<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoughts, <hi>[ad templi Januam manete vos]</hi> ſtay ye here at the Church door, alluding to <hi>Abrahams</hi> words, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. 5. and to <hi>Moſes</hi> deed. <hi>Exod.</hi> 3. 5. <hi>as above in Meditation:</hi> Thus alſo <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>[keep your foot, when you enter into the Houſe of God]</hi> Eccleſ. 5. 1. that is, look well to your affections (thoſe feet and out goings of the Soul) that you offer not the Sacrifice of Fooles. Thus alſo under the Law the inwards and feet were to be waſhed. <hi>Levit.</hi> 1. 9. all which do teach you what due and true preparation, you muſt make for your approaches unto God; that you may lift up holy hands (and an holy heart) unto him in Prayer, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 8. thoſe in, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. 15. <hi>That came to God with their hands full of blood, did</hi> (as it were) <hi>dare him to his face, and they do no leſs, that come with their hands or hearts full of any Sin.</hi>

               <hi>Direct.</hi> or rule, is clean Prayer, be ſure you ſtretch forth you hands in Prayer, with an heart prepared for Prayer, as <hi>Job.</hi> 11. 13. If thou prepareſt thine heart, and ſtretch forth thine hands. and <hi>Ver.</hi> 14. If Iniquity be in thy hands, put it far away, and let not Iniquity be in thy Tabernacle, and <hi>Ver.</hi> 15. then ſhalt thou lift up thy face without Spot, and ſhalt be ſtedfaſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which teaches you, that (1.) your heart muſt be prepared to meet your God, <hi>Amos.</hi> 4. 12. Humbly ſubmitting to his Juſtice, and heartily imploring his mercy. (2.) that you muſt ſtretch forth your hands in prayer <hi>(as the Begger doth for Alms) in forma pauperis,</hi> to receive mercy, or as men Beg quarter for their lives with hands held up over their heads; or laſtly, as one that is falne into a ditch or deep dungeon, and cannot get out, holdeth up his hands and cryeth out for help, you are faln into the dark dungeon of Sin, and Chriſt is your bleſſed <hi>Ebedmelech,</hi> that lets down a Rope of mercy (his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes) to draw you out, as <hi>Jerem.</hi> 38. 12. with all tenderneſs, if you cry unto him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130. 1.</p>
            <p n="11">11. And thirdly thoſe hands you lift up in Prayer muſt be pure hands, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 8. the Fountain of Divine goodneſs will not be laden at with fowle hands, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 1. 15, 16. The Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> gives you good Counſel, (cleanſe your hands) <hi>Jam.</hi> 4. 8. and the Prophet <hi>Jeremy,</hi>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:93853:53"/>
(cleanſe your heart) <hi>Jerem.</hi> 4. 14. and ſo doth bleſſed <hi>Paul</hi> (cleanſe your ſelf from all fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs both of fleſh and of Spirit) 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 1. then ſhall you lift up your face without Spot. That is, you may come to God with comfort and confidence, not caſting down your counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, as guilty <hi>Cain</hi> did, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 6. but looking up boldly and cheerfully as <hi>Steven</hi> did, <hi>Act.</hi> 6. 15. (they ſaw his face, as if it had been the face of an Angel) and then ſhall you ſtand ſtedfaſt in duty as a Pillar in the Temple, <hi>Revel.</hi> 3. 12. your heart being eſtabliſhed with grace, and your mind with peace to ſerve God without fear, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 74. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 112. 7. when the heart is thus fixed (as <hi>Davids</hi> was) <hi>Pſal.</hi> 57. 7. <hi>&amp;</hi> 108. 1. (twice over in both places) this makes duty more eaſy; the expert Souldier having his Arms rightly fixed, goes more cheerfully into the Battel; then Prayer will be your buſineſs, and you will make work of your work; yea God himſelf will not ſtrictly ſtand upon the (exact) purification of the Sanctuary, but will certainly paſs by all your other weakneſſes, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30. 18. when he ſees you prepare your heart to ſeek God, <hi>Ver.</hi> 19. and when he beholds you (to your ability) ſweep out the dirt, waſh the floor, ſpread your beſt Carpets, uncover your beſt Stools, and bring forth your beſt Plate, and Ornaments; ſetting ope the Everlaſting door of your Soul to entertain the King of glory, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 24. 7, 9.</p>

12. The ſecond Rule or <hi>Direction</hi> in duty is Cordial Prayer, be ſure you engage your heart in it. <hi>Jerem.</hi> 30. 21. and in every part of it, that your Prayer may be Cordial, or a hearty prayer, your Tongue and heart muſt be (all a long) Relatives, and keep both time and Tune together; the principal Element of prayer is the heart, take prayer out thence, and 'tis but a dead thing, that prayer which comes out of the head only, and not out of the heart alſo, is not prayer in Gods account. <hi>Ephraim</hi> was a ſilly Dove without heart, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 7. 11. The <hi>Jews</hi> (no doubt) had prayed much and oft during their ſeventy years Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, yet <hi>Daniel</hi> denies that they had prayed at all, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 13. (yet made we not our prayer unto the Lord our God, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> Seeing, no Affection, nor heart was in their prayers, all was but lip-labour, they gave God not the Calves of their lips, as <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14. 2. but only the lips of their Calves, which God eſteemed no better then <hi>Jeroboams</hi> Calves; when the Tongue prays without the heart 'tis but an empty Ring, the tinkling of a <hi>Cymbal.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 15. Expreſſions of the Tongue without Impreſſions on the heart, makes no Melody in Gods ear, <hi>non vox, ſed votum, non Muſica Chordula, ſed Cor.</hi> When the inward Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice is not joyned with the outward, God faith (in contempt of it) they offer me fleſh, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 8. 13. Fleſh ſtinks in our Noſtrils while
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:93853:54"/>
it is burning: when both were joined toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, God calls it his <hi>Honey-Comb</hi> with his <hi>Honey,</hi> Cant. 5. 1. <hi>Eleazar</hi> the prieſt carried the Incenſe in his boſome (to ſhew that prayer ſhould come from the heart) as he carried the Oil for the Lamps in his right hand, the anointing Oile in his left hand, and the meat offering upon his Shoulder, as <hi>Rabbi, Elias,</hi> and <hi>Chaskuny</hi> upon, <hi>Numb.</hi> 4. 16. telleth us. <hi>David</hi> found in his heart to pray his prayer to God. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 27. he did not only ſay his prayer (with his lips) but he alſo pray'd his prayer (with his heart.) Prayer without the heart is like the Body without the Soul; O how loathſome to man is this latter, and as loathſome to God is the former, then draw you near with a true heart. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 22.</p>
            <p n="13">13. As your Prayer muſt be hearty or Cordial (for <hi>quod cor non facit, non fit,</hi> that which the heart doth not, is not done at all; if your heart be Right, God will give you his hand, and you may come into the Chariot of Prayer: as 2 <hi>King.</hi> 10. 15. which is as the Chariot of <hi>Amminadab,</hi> Cant. 6. 12. but if your heart be not right in the ſight of God, as <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 21. <hi>You have neither part nor portion in this matter; and you do but take the Name of the Lord in vain, and God will not hold you guiltleſs,</hi> Exod. 20. 7.) So it muſt be conſtant which is the Third <hi>Direction,</hi> conſtant prayer:
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:93853:54"/>
and this conſtancy is two fold. Firſt, in duty, and ſecondly to duty. The firſt relates to this or that duty of Prayer in particular. The ſecond relates to the duty of Prayer in the general; touching the firſt, your heart muſt be conſtant in prayer, O the backwardneſs of the heart of Man, to praying work ('twill take a diſpenſation for a diſcharge from duty, any ſmall Interruption for a while, to ſtop the mouth of Conſcience, is an excuſe from pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er) and O the lubricity and ſlipperineſs of the heart of Man in praying work; as the heart naturally hangs off from it, ſo it uſually, when it comes into it, ſlips out of it again; 'tis like <hi>Reuben</hi> as unſtable as water, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. 4. though it be not ſo <hi>liquid</hi> as water to be poured out (as water) before the Lord, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 6. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62. 8. (which is the proper Notion of prayer, to wit, the pouring out of the heart unto God) there is too much of the ſtone in the heart, that is yet undiſſolved into tears and tenderneſs. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 26. you will find by woful experience, that your heart will not be ſtedfaſt with God, but it will ſtart aſide like a deceitful bow, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. 37, <hi>&amp;</hi> 57. you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not watch with Chriſt (in praying work) one hour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 40. you cannot ſerve the Lord without diſtraction; Nor attend upon him in prayer, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 35.</p>
            <p n="14">14. Therefore as your heart ſtands need of whipping to Prayer, it ſtands as much need
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:93853:55" rendition="simple:additions"/>

Hence it is, that <hi>David</hi> begs of God: Lord unite my heart to fear thy Name, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 86. 11. he found it as hard to fix, as the <hi>Chymiſt</hi> doth <hi>Quick-ſilver,</hi> which hath a principle of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in it, but not of Reſt; and therefore you are commanded to watch unto prayer, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 7. <hi>Satan</hi> will be Interrupting you, as the <hi>Pythoniſſe</hi> did <hi>Paul, Act.</hi> 16. 16, and as the Enemies did <hi>Nehemiah.</hi> Neh. 4. 17. he built and watched, and watched and built. So ſhould you pray and watch, and watch and pray. <hi>Satan</hi> is always buſieſt at the beſt work, if you ſtand up (in prayer) before the Lord, he will be ſure to ſtand up againſt you, <hi>Zech.</hi> 3. 1, 2. <hi>If you be at Gods right hand,</hi> Satan <hi>will be at your right hand;</hi> he will thruſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in among the Sons of God, <hi>Job.</hi> 1. 6. but ſuppoſe he tempt you not, your own heart (ſo far as 'tis unrenewed) will be a tempter to it ſelf, and will wander from duty, the Man in the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Hiſtory, that was to have an horſe given him, if he could ſay his Lords Prayer, without a wandring thought; cryed in the midſt of the prayer <hi>(dabis &amp; ephippium)</hi> you muſt give me the ſaddle too, ſo loſt both horſe and ſaddle, this divided heart, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 10. 2. makes us loſe many a duty.</p>

15. The ſecond branch is conſtancy to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer, you muſt give your ſelf to prayer; as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 109. 4. <hi>Hebr. (Vaani Teph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>illah)</hi> but I am prayer, as if he had been made up of nothing elſe, but been a meer compound of prayer; or as if he had done nothing elſe (in all the world) but poured out his heart to God in prayer. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> moves this Queſtion, why <hi>David</hi> is called (a man after Gods own heart) more then <hi>Moſes</hi> or <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> &amp;c. And for his Anſwer to it he gives this Reaſon, becauſe he was more Converſant with God in (both) praying and praiſing work; he (above all others) turns every providence into a prayer, and his whole Book of <hi>Pſalms</hi> conſiſts either of <hi>Hoſannas</hi> (in praying to) or of <hi>Hallelujahs</hi> (in praiſing of) his God. He is the greateſt favourite to an Earthly King, that is oftneſt converſant with him. Thus <hi>David</hi> was Gods darling, his ſpecial minion and favourite, that was much in Gods boſom in his Divine <hi>Colloquies.</hi> So that he would be up, and at this praying work three times in a day; Morning, Noon, and Night, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55. 17. and, as if this had been too little for him he will be at it ſeven times a day, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 164. that is, very often, as often as God reard him up an Altar, ſo oft he had ready his Sacrifice, not as <hi>Formaliſts</hi> do (that make means their Mediators) in a cold careleſs and cuſtomary manner, walking the round of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:93853:56" rendition="simple:additions"/>
duty as the Horſe in the Mill, but <hi>David</hi> rouſed himſelf, and cryed aloud not only <hi>(precem fundere)</hi> but also <hi>(Coelum tundere)</hi> to batter Heaven by his prayers, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 3. 4. &amp; 107. 6, 13. &amp; 120. 1. &amp; 130. 1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="16">16. You are commanded in Scripture to pray always, evermore, every where, without ceaſing, continually, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 18. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 17. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 1. <hi>Col.</hi> 4. 2. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 8. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 6. <hi>There is no duty ſo oft commanded as Prayer,</hi> it muſt be your conſtant Trade; and that Divine breath, which you muſt conſtantly draw: <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3. 10. (night and day praying exceedingly) as if his practice had been nothing but prayer. It may have Intermiſſion, but never any ceſſation in ſound ſenſe: not as the <hi>Euchites</hi> of old and <hi>Monks</hi> of late hath imagined, as if God would have men to caſt off all care and callings, and do nothing elſe but pray. For the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> (whom the Apoſtle bids to pray without ceaſing, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 17.) are commanded alſo to work with their hands, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. 11. <hi>And the Apoſtle tells them, if any will not work, neither ſhall he eat,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3. 10. Men cannot be as Angels in this World, that need no Food no nor yet as Lillies. (which Chriſt ſpeaks of) that neither Card nor Spin, Sow nor Reap, toil nor take pains, yet are nour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed and arrayed. Every good Man muſt have a particular calling to honour God in
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:93853:56" rendition="simple:additions"/>
his Generation-work, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 36. which may not be juſtled out by any duty of his general calling.</p>
            <p n="17">17. But the true ſenſe is, <hi>(1ſt.)</hi> that you ſhould obſerve ſtated times of prayer (morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and evening) in this ſenſe, the word (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually) is uſed, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9. 7. (thou ſhalt eat bread at my Table continually) you cannot imagin, that <hi>Mephiboſheth</hi> did nothing elſe night and day, but eat at <hi>Davids</hi> Table (for ſo he had been an unparaleld <hi>Cormorant)</hi> but only that he ſhould obſerve his ſet and appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted meals. <hi>(2ly.)</hi> 'tis an <hi>Hyperbolical</hi> ſpeech exhorting to frequency of prayer. Thus, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 3. <hi>Paul</hi> remembred <hi>Timothy</hi> in prayer night and day; Thus he did remember the Romans, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 9. as before the <hi>Theſſalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians.</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3. 10. you ſhould be as fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent (in Supplication) with your Spiritual Father, as your Spiritual Enemies are frequent (in Temptation) with you: as the fleſh world and <hi>Devil</hi> (ſome, or all) do aſſault you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually; So you had need pray againſt their aſſaults continually, to fetch in ſtrength and relief againſt them from God.</p>
            <p n="18">18. The third ſenſe is, that your prayer ſhould ſpread it ſelf over all your concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. As the Temple (that Houſe of prayer) Sanctified the Gold and all other Materials and Utenſils in it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 17.

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:93853:57" rendition="simple:additions"/>
All Ordinances, all Providences, all Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, all Employments, prayer doth not only Gild them over, but alſo turns them into the fineſt Gold. So that to pray continually, is to carry this Temple (as <hi>Auſtin</hi> called it) about with you at all times in all places, upon all occaſions and in all conditions, yea all your life, even to your very death: this Spiritual breath muſt conterminate with your Natural. For the laſt work of a dying Chriſtian is to breath out this prayer, <hi>Lord Jeſus receive my Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="19">19. The fourth true ſenſe of praying al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways and continually, is the keeping of your heart in a praying frame continually: ſo that upon all occaſions (that occur) you may be lifting up your heart, your thoughts and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections unto God (whom you have ſet always before you, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. 8.) and darting out frequent <hi>Ejaculations</hi> to the Throne of grace. Thus your Harp (or heart) ſhould be ever kept in Tune for prayer, as the Souldier hath his Armes ready by him, and right fixed upon any Aſſault of the Enemy: and as the fire in your gueſt Chamber, it is always prepared (though it do not ever burn or blaze out) upon your friends coming to be blown up into a Flame: thus you may pray, when you do not ſet your ſelf a-part to pray, even in the works of your callings; and beſides your ſet Meals for your Soul (in your Morning and
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:93853:57" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Evening prayer, called the continual Sacrifice, <hi>Numb.</hi> 28. 3, 4. as well as for your body; you have many other refreſhing morſels (to wit, occaſional <hi>Apoſtrophes</hi> and <hi>Ejaculations)</hi> to nouriſh the inner, man and to make it increaſe with the increaſings of God, through the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 19. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 16. &amp; <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 19.</p>
            <p n="20">20. Thus to pray continually <hi>(quoties ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid occurrit,</hi> as Dr. <hi>Willet</hi> ſenſes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 12. as oft as any thing falls out, that calls for Divine aſſiſtance) 'tis not only your duty but your priviledge; 'tis like the herb <hi>(All-heal)</hi> an univerſal remedy againſt all diſeaſes, a choice yet a cheap <hi>Catholicon</hi> and <hi>Antidote</hi> both againſt the evil of ſinning and off ſuffring: This is the beſt and moſt bleſt Expedient to avoid dangers, to overcome difficulties and to procure both ſafety and ſucceſs, in all your honeſt deſigns. Thu, <hi>Nehemiah</hi> before he opens his mouth to the King, even in the Kings preſence, firſt opens his heart to God, <hi>Neh.</hi> 2. 4. his ſudden and ſecret <hi>Ejaculation</hi> he dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted up to God (for ordering his ſpeech and ſpeeding his Petition) is called, his praying to the God of Heaven: and this was his fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent practice upon ſeveral other providences, <hi>Neh.</hi> 5. 19. <hi>&amp;</hi> 6. 14. <hi>&amp;</hi> 13. 29. Thus <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> ſervant darted out deſires to God, that he might proſper in his Enterprize, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24. 12. 26. Thus <hi>Moſes</hi> cryed to God, yet ſaid
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:93853:58"/>
nothing, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. 15. Thus <hi>Hannah</hi> was not heard, yet prayed, and thus wherever God ſets you up an Alter, you muſt be ready to offer Sacrifice, crying, either <hi>mentally</hi> or <hi>vocally,</hi> Lord proſper me in this work, Lord protect me in this Journey, Lord direct me in this duty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus Chriſt often did for you.</p>
            <p n="21">21. The fourth <hi>Direction</hi> is, your prayer muſt be earneſt and intent, or inſtant, you muſt not only pray but cry, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130. 1. out of the depth have I cryed unto thee. <hi>David</hi> crys there (and in many other places) unto God with his utmoſt ſtrength, out of the depth of his heart. You muſt be ſervent in it, as well as conſtant to it; neither the frequency nor the fervency of prayer ought to be abated, prayer is cal'd wreſtling, which requires your utmoſt ſtrength as well as skill; it requires the very ſtrength of your affections, you muſt be fervent in Spirit, while you are ſerving the Lord, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 11. and be inſtant as well as conſtant in it, <hi>Ver.</hi> 12. your heart muſt be ſeething-hot as the word there [<gap reason="foreign">

God loves not cold prayers (as ſome men love not cold diſhes) yea even lukewarm,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:93853:58"/>
hearts are <hi>Nauſeous</hi> to him. <hi>Revel.</hi> 3. 16. every offering, that is of a ſweet Savour, is made by fire unto the Lord, <hi>Levit.</hi> 1. 9, 13, 17. 'Tis three times over, every Sacrifice muſt have fire in it aſwel as Salt, <hi>Mark.</hi> 9. 49. the fire of Zealous Devotion as well as the Salt of truth and ſincerity: yea the Sacrificer (as well as the Sacrifice) muſt have both thoſe Ingredients (Salt and Fire) in him. You muſt have the grace of truth <hi>(Pſal.</hi> 51. 6.) which (as Salt) muſt dry up thoſe evil humours in you, that would breed the never dying Worm; and you muſt have the grace of Zeal, which (as fire) muſt burn up thoſe corruptions in you, that (otherwiſe) would carry you to that unquenchable Fire, <hi>Mark.</hi> 9. 43, 44. 45, 46, 47, 48.</p>
            <p n="22">22. This bleſſed Spirit of burning (ſo cal'd, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 4. 4. that makes a true and through com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtion among your fleſhly corruptions) muſt prevent you of everlaſting burnings, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33. 14. <hi>as the Sun of the Firmament</hi> (with 'its hot Beams <hi>will eat out the Kitchin-Fire, that is upon the Hearth.</hi> So this <hi>Coeleſtial</hi> Fire (of Zeal and fervency for God in prayer, which is indeed a warm beam of the Sun of Righteouſneſs, <hi>Mal.</hi> 4. 2.) will eat out the ſtinking fire of Sin that is in your heart.

So you muſt not only have the water of godly ſorrow and Goſpel repentance, but alſo the fire of Zeal and ſervent Devotion to make an acceptable prayer unto God. The fire of <hi>Aetna</hi> and the water of <hi>Nilus,</hi> are ſaid to be the <hi>Hierogly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicks,</hi> of thoſe choice Ingredients of a rightly compounded prayer; God requires hot bread to be ſet before him daily. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21. 6.</p>
            <p n="23">23. The breath that a pair of bellows breaths out, is cold breath, and ſo is it not properly breath but wind; accordingly cold prayers, that are careleſly breathed out, are not truly prayer, but wind and vanity: the breath of a living Man, is not cold as bellows breath, but warm; the lack of ſervency is the loſs of prayer. God will be cold and careleſs in accepting and anſwering, if you dare be cold and careleſs in asking his face and favour. <hi>Paul</hi> tells you of your great need, both of the ſhield of Faith (that is defenſive Armour) and of the darts of prayer (which is offenſive Armour) <hi>Ephe.</hi> 6. 16, 18. <hi>Now this dart will not wound your Spiritual Enemies, unleſs it be well-pointed, ſteeled and ſharpened with Zeal:</hi> when the Souldier ſtrikes with his full ſtrength, then doth he give his Enemy the Mortal

wound. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, what you do, you muſt do with all your might, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9. 10. you muſt much more pray (the beſt of duties) with all your might. <hi>David</hi> danced before the Lord with all his might, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. 14. ſurely he (much more) prayed with all his might, he prayed and cryed with his whole heart. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 58, 145. <hi>Sampſon alſo bowed himſelf with all his might at the pillars of Dagons Temple, Judg.</hi> 16, 30. and ſurely had he not prayed with all his might likewiſe, <hi>Ver.</hi> 28. he ſhould never have been enrolled in that little Book of <hi>Martyrs,</hi> amongſt thoſe great Favourites of Heaven. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11. 32.</p>

Chriſt is the only maſter of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts. <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 23, 24, 26. <hi>&amp; Eph.</hi> 3. 12. The old Teſtament Saints cryed in prayer (for the Lords ſake) <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 17. and the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Saints cry alſo (for Chriſts ſake, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 16.) Upon a two-fold account. (1.) As he is the only purchaſer of acceſs to God; we are afar off in the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> but brought nigh by the

ſecond, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 13, 14. putting on us his own Robe for acceptance. (2.) He is the only Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator of the Church, the keeper of the great Seal in Heaven, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 5. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 27, 37. <hi>&amp; Joh.</hi> 17. 12. this is ſhadowed to you, as (1.) No man was to offer up his own Sacrifice, but he muſt put it into the hands of the Prieſt to offer it for him, <hi>Levit.</hi> 1. 15, 17. <hi>burn it and bring it,</hi> &amp;c. (2.) Every loaf of ſhew-bread had a diſh of Frankincenſe upon it to perfume it for acceptance, <hi>Levit.</hi> 24. 7. (3.) While the people were praying without, <hi>Zechary</hi> (the Prieſt) was offering Incenſe within, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 10. (4.) The brazen Altar for Sacrifice was placed before the Golden Altar for Incenſe, to ſhew, there is no admiſſion for prayer as Incenſe, till firſt Chriſt our Sacrifice give us our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, <hi>Exod.</hi> 38. 30, <hi>&amp;</hi> 39, 40. as <hi>Jacob</hi> got the bleſſing in the garments of the Elder bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Gen.</hi> 27. 15. to 29.</p>
            <p n="28">28. The ſecond general is the matter of your prayer (as before the manner of it) to wit, according to Gods will, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 14. now his will is known either by his precepts (what he hath commanded) or by his promiſes (what he hath <hi>(ovenanted)</hi> or by his Prophecies, (what he hath foretold) thoſe muſt be the bounds of prayer, or more briefly, thoſe three may be reduced into one, for Divine precepts and Prophecies are propounded to us in the nature of promiſes, and ſo the Divine promiſe is the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:93853:62"/>
ground of every right humane prayer: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever faith finds a promiſe, it turns that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe into a Prayer, and then God turns his promiſe into a performance: Now the Divine promiſe (which is the Chriſtians Charter,) (I will be to you a God, <hi>&amp;c. Hebr.</hi> 8. 10. and all are yours, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 22.) is wide enough in the general, and there is no Cauſe, why we ſhould deſire 'tis further Enlargement. Beſides, there is no condition you can fall into, but there is a particular promiſe to that Condition, if the word of Chriſt dwell richly in you, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 16. <hi>So as to find out all thoſe Herbs of grace that grow in the Garden of the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi>

            <p n="30">30. Laſtly, the conſequent duties after pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er be four. 1 walk humbly. 2 wait patiently. 3 work diligently. 4 wear thankfully what you win by Prayer. Firſt, of the firſt walk hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, if you have been truly and throughly ſervent in your praying work, you will be very apt to catch cold after it, and therefore you muſt ſtill keep walking after duty, and cool not over haſtily, leſt you catch a cold, and ſo a Conſumption, as before in the Chapter of Meditation; you ſhould take down your Soul by degrees, and not grow remiſs all on the ſudden, by letting your Spirit run freely into the World, immediatly after your warm converſing with your God. For there is the danger of deepeſt withdrawments to humble you, after you have had the priviledg of high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Enlargements to help you, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 1, 2. after the ſpouſe had been moſt largely feaſting with her bridgeroom, the very next news we hear of her, is, that ſhe was fallen into a Spiritual ſlumber; you may ſuppoſe it was through the want of this care, ſhe over-ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly

cooled, and ſo catched a Spiritual cold, and had ſhe not had a bleſſed Phyſician (that was as willing as able to help and heal her, ſhe might have fallen into a Spiritual Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption; can you be thus wiſe for your body (in preventing ſuch a danger the worſer part of you which you have in common with beaſts, how much more ought you to be thus wiſe for your Soul, that better part which you have in common with Angels: beaſts have bodies as well as men, and Angels are Spirits as men have Spirits: O be not more careful of the beaſt then of the Angel in you.</p>
            <p n="31">31. And you muſt walk humbly (too after Prayer: Pride often follow Prayer, and the worſt Pride after the beſt Prayer you cannot be ignorant of <hi>Satans</hi> devices working in your own heart, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 11.

after Prayer how your heart hath wandred in your work. <hi>Moſes</hi> could not keep his hands ſteady in prayer ('tis only proper to God to have his hand ſtretched out ſtill) nor you your heart; the beſt of Men cannot undergo any long intention, you may be weary (in) prayer, when you are not weary (of) Prayer. As this review of your frailty in Prayer may humble you, ſo it may help you againſt both reſting in, and truſting to your Prayer: alas in ſo doing, you have been drawing nigh to Prayer, not drawing nigh to God, which is the true notion of Prayer, and you do verily reſt in it and truſt upon it, when your admiring thoughts do (after duty) run out more upon your prayer, then upon your God hearing prayer, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65. 3. you muſt forget your Prayer and remember your God, can you but Conſider, the iniquity of your holy things, then Prayer will be your nothing and Chriſt your all, and in all, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 11. If it ſtand for any thing, It muſt be only for an Evidence, not a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.</p>
            <p n="32">32. The ſecond rule or direction is, wait patiently for an Anſwer to your Prayer. When <hi>David</hi> had Marſhald (as the <hi>Hebr.

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:93853:64"/>
muſt mind your Arrow you ſhoot up to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, whether it fall ſhort or over, as <hi>Jonathan</hi> did his, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20. 21. what becomes of your Rich-Ship you adventure to the Cape of good hope, as the Merchant doth his: how it fares with your precious ſeed (ſo Prayer is called, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 126. 6.) that you ſow upon the Throne of grace (a far more fruitful Soil then that of <hi>Iſaac</hi> which brought forth an 100. ſold. <hi>Gen.</hi> 26. 12.) as the Husbandman doth with his. <hi>Noah</hi> minded what tidings his Dove brought him, and every Man minds what meſſage his meſſenger brings him: you may not caſt the Angling rod of Prayer, into the vaſt Ocean of Divine love, and never obſerve what it brings to your hand, if rightly hooked and bated: you may not be as <hi>Pilate</hi> who ſcof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fingly asked what is truth, but waited not for an Anſwer, <hi>Joh.</hi> 18. 38.</p>
            <p n="33">33. You muſt therefore look up after Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and obſerve what becomes of your Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, what acceſs it hath to God; what accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance it hath with God, and what returns it brings from God. If you believe that God hearkens what you ſpeak to him, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 16. there is much Reaſon, that you ſhould alſo hearken what God will ſpeak to you, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85. 8. you muſt look out of yourſelf and up to God, that looks out of himſelf and down to you, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 113. 6. and though this poſture of looking up, be a weariſom poſture, yet muſt
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:93853:65" rendition="simple:additions"/>
you not be weary of it; wait patiently, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40. 1. as thoſe that wait for the morning, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130. 6. in due ſeaſon you ſhall Reap, if you faint not, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 9. for God waiteth on you that he may be gracious in the beſt ſeaſon, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30. 18. your waiting on God is there called bleſſed work, and if the great God wait on ſuch a worthleſs worm as you, <hi>(tantus tantillum.</hi> Job 25. 6.) how much more muſt you wait on him; and not offer up <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thulian</hi> Prayers (as in the <hi>Apocryphal Judeth.</hi> Chap. 7. 30. limiting God to 5. days or give up all which ought not to be done, <hi>Pſal</hi> 78. 41. to limit God is but to Tempt him: his delay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is not denying, 'tis but a commending his mercy (you beg) to you, <hi>Cito data Vileſcunt.</hi> Mercies lightly Obtained; are but lightly eſteemed, and it may be, God ſtays to bring a great many mercies together, and you will ſurely look up and not loſe that mercy, which long waiting hands in to you.</p>
            <p n="34">34.

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:93853:65" rendition="simple:additions"/>
end to God; and 'tis not only careleſs oſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancy, but a plain tempting of God to neglect any means that God gives you to accompliſh the end, you may not expect to ſtumble upon mercy, you do not ſo for the body, (ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times overuſing means) why ſhould you for your Soul? You are bid to Aske, ſeek and knock, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 7. you muſt Aske with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, ſeek with diligence, and knock with perſeverance. In the ſweat of your brows you muſt eat your Spiritual bread as well as Corporal; as you lift up your hands in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the end, ſo you muſt lift up your hands in practiſing the means that have a tendency to the end, be ſure you do not firſt pray againſt your Sins; and then go away and Sin againſt your Prayers, this is but a mocking of God, and he will not be ſo, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 7.</p>
            <p n="35">35. The fourth Direction is, wear thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, all that you win by Prayer; what you win by Prayer, you muſt wear with thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, as you have made Prayer your refuge, ſo muſt you make praiſe your Recompence. <hi>Davids Pſalms</hi> were not all <hi>Hoſannah</hi>'s, or Prayers to God, but he had his <hi>Hallelujahs</hi> alſo, his <hi>Pſalms</hi> that were praiſes of God as before: Prayer is the ſeed of praiſe, and 'its pity that when the joy of harveſt (which is paralel to the joy of Marriage and to the joy of Victory) doth come, that the God of all joy and comfort ſhould not have his thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offering.
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:93853:66"/>
God took it unkindly from <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah</hi> that he Rendered not to the Lord accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his loving kindneſs to him, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32. 28. and he took it kindly from <hi>David,</hi> that he made it his Spiritual Study and project, how to render to the Lord [what ſhall I Render to the Lord for all his benefits towards me,] <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116. 12. the bleſſed Man was in an holy Extaſy, and in a deep demur with himſelf, what he might do beſt for ſo good a God. He had nothing to give, ſo faith, what ſhall I Render, and he had nothing good enough to Render to him who is the chiefeſt good. Ten <hi>Lepers</hi> cryed for healing, <hi>Luke</hi> 17. 12, 17. But when all were healed, but one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to praiſe Chriſt, and he is praiſed of Chriſt. God hath but the tenth of praiſes, and 'tis ten to one whether you practice his praiſe, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 9.</p>

            <head>Of Hearing the Word. CHAP. V.</head>
            <p n="1">1. THe third Religious duty wherein you muſt ſerve God, is the Hearing and Reading of his Word; that you have the word of God to Read and Hear, you muſt prize as a precious priviledg, and praiſe the Lord for it, with your heart, lips, and life: God hath depoſited a Rich Treaſure with you in lending you his Word and Goſpel. You might have been begging drops of mercy in <hi>Hell</hi> at this time, when behold God offers you <hi>Oceans</hi> of grace on Earth in his Word and Goſpel. O what would the damned give (even ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Worlds if they had them) to enjoy ſuch means of grace (yea but one day thereof) and ſuch days of Salvation as are beſtowed upon you; God hath not dealt ſo with many Nations, nor with many perſons, as he hath dealt with you and the Land of your Nativity, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147. 19, 20. 'twas a Special favour and vouchſafement to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that God committed to them the lively (and life-giving) Oracles, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 2. there is a (chiefly) ſet upon it;
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:93853:67"/>
being a matter of great truſt, to know your Maſters Will is a choice Talent. There is (much) in that of <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 48. (as there was (chiefely in the other) the word [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>] Signifies to depoſit or lay up, as a matter of great worth: The poor <hi>Pagan</hi> World lay under a long night of darkneſs (having only the twinkling Star light of the fallen nature) wherein they wander wofully, yet not ſo wide as to miſs of <hi>Hell.</hi> Their Star-light indeed leaves them [<gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>] inexcuſable, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 20. but cannot lead them to the Star of <hi>Jacob,</hi> the bright and Morning Star, nor to life and Salvation, <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 12.</p>
            <p n="2">2. God hath Magnified above all things his name by his Word, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 138. 2. To the words (there) may be Read: or as our Reading is, thou haſt Magnified thy word above all thy Name. If God Magnifie his word above all, how ſhould you Magnifie it accordingly while you have the day of Salvation, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 2. The word muſt be admired and highly eſteemed before it have a through work upon your heart, <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 48. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3. 1, 2. You muſt eſteem it (as <hi>Job</hi> did) not only above your dainties and ſuperfluities, but even above your neceſſary food (without which you cannot Subſiſt,) <hi>Job.</hi> 23. 12. 'Tis better to want your daily bread (that periſheth with uſing then this bread of life, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 27. I had rather want meat, drink, ſleep, ſight, light, any thing,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:93853:67"/>
every thing, ſaid <hi>Selneccer,</hi> then want the word of God; and <hi>Luthers</hi> Rapture was, I had rather live in <hi>Hell</hi> with it, then in Heaven without it. O then what a bleſſing do you enjoy in hearing the Word, 'tis <hi>[Epiſtola Creatoris ad Creaturam]</hi> Gods letter from Heaven to Man, the very Reading whereof hath a bleſſedneſs annexed to it, <hi>Revel.</hi> 1. 3. So it be but Read both with affection and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication.</p>
            <p n="3">3. More particularly, there is a three fould duty to be obſerved in this Religious exerciſe, as in the former; 1 Something before. 2 Something in, and 3 Something after. In all theſe the heart of Man is apt to miſcarry, as Chriſt intimates in two Cautions he gives you, <hi>Mark</hi> 4. 24. take heed [what] you hear, and <hi>Luke</hi> 8. 18. take heed [how] you hear. In the former he Cautions you about the matter of your hearing, and in the latter, about the manner of it. As to the firſt of thoſe, you muſt be like the careful Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who is very choice in his ſeed, very Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and Critical, he will not commit corrupt ſeed to his fruitful Soil; ſo neither muſt you lend your ear to the <hi>Devil</hi> or to any of his <hi>Chaplains:</hi> Sin came into the World, firſt by the door of the ear, your great grand-Mother <hi>Eve</hi> liſtned more to <hi>Satans</hi> lies then to Gods truth; and though the <hi>Devil</hi> be not ever <hi>(Mendax)</hi> a lyar, yet is he <hi>(Semper-fallax)</hi>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:93853:68"/>
always decitful, ſpeaking truth only with a purpoſe to deceive. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 3. a cozener.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The <hi>Devil</hi> did only Equivocate to our firſt Parents, yet is he called a down-right lyar, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 44, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He began his Kingdom by a lie, and he upholds it by lies to this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent day. O how ſhameful then or rather ſhameleſs are thoſe <hi>Popiſh Doctors</hi> that Preach up Equivocation, as a comfortable Doctrin to afflicted <hi>Catholicks;</hi> calling back (as it were) that peſt from <hi>Hell,</hi> and from that old <hi>Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocator:</hi> that ſubtle <hi>Serpent</hi> when he was but young, out-witted your firſt Parents, now that he is old, and ye young Children, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 14. take heed he doth not cozen you either by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or by any of his Chaplains, with their finely ſpun Threds of <hi>Popery.</hi> Chriſt ſaith, my ſheep hear them not, for they know not the voice of ſtrangers <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 5, 8. for they have their Senſes exerciſed to diſcern good and evil, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 5. 14. yea they have a Spirit of diſcerning, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 10. <hi>to diſcerne the mind of Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 16. <hi>Bread from Stones, and fiſh from Serpents, and what the Chaff is to the Wheat,</hi> Jer. 23-28. <hi>they hate euery falſe way,</hi> Pſal. 119. 104. <hi>and 'tis Impoſſible for them to be fully and finally deceiued,</hi> Matth. 24. 24. you may know thoſe Impoſters by their light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as well as by their lies, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. 32. they ſhall not profit this people at all ſaith the Lord, and yet they may much hurt them, <hi>Lam.</hi> 2. 14.

looſe and lewd courſes as well as loud and lying diſcourſes are the brand, God puts upon <hi>Satans Spelman:</hi> by their fruits you ſhall know them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 15, 16. the evil communication of ſuch (as are Trumpe and Triumphant in this day) do corrupt good manners, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 33.</p>
            <p n="5">5. As hitherto of the matter, ſo now of the manner of hearing. Herein Obſerve thoſe <hi>Directions,</hi> 1 Before hearing, 2 In it, and 3 after it. Firſt before, you muſt prepare to meet your God in this duty alſo, as well as in the two former, to which I refer you: More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, your heart muſt be prepared for this duty more eſpecially. Firſt <hi>Direct.</hi> by laying aſide all filthineſs and ſuperfluity of naughtineſs, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 21. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 1, 2. <hi>when you come to the ſincere Milk of the Word,</hi> your fallow ground muſt be plowed up that you ſow not among Thorns. <hi>Jer.</hi> 4. 3, 4. If your ſtomach be ſoul and clogged with bad humours, you firſt purge it, before you feed and fill it, otherwiſe what-ever you Eat, will but nouriſh thoſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and morbifick Humours: ſo will it be with your Soul when 'tis clogged with Sin. Chriſts Market is then fore-ſtalled, and your heart ſo fraught with falſe Lovers, and like the Inn at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> ſo full of other Gueſts, that there will be no Room for Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 7. There is much unſuitableneſs betwixt a filthy Spirit and the pure word of God, and
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:93853:69"/>
therefore muſt you put away all filthineſs (both of fleſh and Spirit, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 1.) never to have any more to do with your idols, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 30. 22. pull up every weed and caſt it away to prepare for the ſeed; the Houſe muſt be ſwept clean for Entertaining the King of glory.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The ſecond <hi>Direct.</hi> about preparation is, you muſt lay aſide not only all filthy Sins, but alſo all worldly thoughts and cares of this life, which will choak the ſeed of the Word, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 22. Eſpecially when thoſe Thorns overtop the Corn, which naturally they will do: 'tis good ground (indeed) 'tis a good heart, wherein grace over-tops corruption and not corruption grace. Wherefore lay Gods charge upon Worldly cares, that they ſtay at Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>door (with <hi>Bernard)</hi> and at the foot of the hill of God (with <hi>Abraham)</hi> as above; but they muſt not go up, or in with you, if they preſume to preſs in with you, drive them away, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did the Fowls that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed, if not defiled his Sacrifice, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 11. The <hi>Rabbies</hi> ſay, that in the Temple though there was much fleſh for Sacrifice uſed in it, yet not ſo much as one Flie was ſeen ſtirring there.

            <p n="7">7. The third <hi>Direction</hi> for preparing your heart to this Religious duty is, beware of a prejudiced Spirit, either againſt the perſon Teaching or againſt the Doctrin Taught. 1. You may not have a prejudicate opinion againſt the Teacher, if once you diſtaſt his perſon, you can never reliſh his Doctrin: the beſt of Miniſters are expoſed to prejudice, even Chriſt himſelf (that <hi>Palmoni Hamadabber</hi> Dan. 8. 13. or Prince of Preachers) was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally cavilled at, <hi>viz.</hi> Is not this the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter?</hi> And can any good thing come out of <hi>Nazareth? &amp;c.</hi> If this did befal that green Tree, what can the dry expect, <hi>Mark.</hi> 6. 3. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 46. <hi>Luk.</hi> 23. 31. Hence <hi>Paul</hi> admoniſhed <hi>Timothy,</hi> ſo to behave himſelf in the Church of God that none might deſpiſe his youth, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 12. this is a great Impediment to a proſpering and profitting Goſpel: the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then</hi> could ſay <hi>(Inter ſenum deliria &amp; Juvenum praejudicia cadit Reſpublica)</hi> 'twixt the dotage of old men and the prejudice of young men the Common-wealth falleth. O that we had not cauſe to ſay, that betwixt thoſe two <hi>(cadit Religio)</hi> the common Salvation falleth: the plaineſt Preachers are exploded by ſuch, as if they ſtood not in need to be put in Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of thoſe things they know, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 12.
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:93853:70"/>
The end of Preaching is not only to inform the Judgment, but alſo to reform the affections, not only to teach Men what they know not, but alſo to ſtir them up to Practiſe what they know. 'Tis ordain'd for this as well as that.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Neither <hi>2ly.</hi> muſt you have prejudice againſt the truth taught; as thoſe of Itching ears, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 3. not abiding ſound Doctrin, as fore eyes not enduring the Sun-ſhine, the fault is not in the Sun, but in the eyes: ſo 'tis not in the Doctrin, but in them which ſavours no Doctrine, ſave that which ſuites with their Itching tempers, being not willing to frame the heart to the Word, but rather deſirous to have the Word framed to the heart. Thus Carnal men deſpiſe Prophecying, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. 12, 20. and plain Preaching is fooliſhneſs to them. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 21. though it be under the bleſſing of a Divine Inſtitution in that phraſe (It pleaſed God) which is not ſo Solemnly ſet upon bare Reading the Word: you may (indeed) and muſt try the Spirits, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 1. and prove all things in Order to the holding faſt of that which is good, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 21. as thoſe well bred <hi>Bereans</hi> did, <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 11. and if you find the grain good, never quarrel with the ſeeds-man: <hi>Elias</hi>'s food was acceptable to him, though unclean <hi>Ravens</hi> were his <hi>Servitours,</hi> and Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Coin is not to be refuſed though from a <hi>Leprous</hi> hand, yet 'tis ever beſt from a <hi>Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas,</hi> Act. 11. 24. of all others.</p>

9. The fourth <hi>Direct.</hi> herein is, beware of preſumption as well as prejudice, that you come not to the word with an heart reſolved (before hand) what to do, let God and his Miniſters ſay what they pleaſe, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 25. ſo as to take your own way and to follow your own courſe, <hi>Jer.</hi> 44. 16, 17. as if you ſcorn'd to bend to truth; this is proud obſtinacy or ſtubborn pride which you muſt abandon. Say not, you know enough already, for you know nothing yet as you ought to know, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 2. you muſt become a fool for Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 18. and ſit down at the very foot of God, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 41. 2. to receive his Law. <hi>Deut.</hi> 3. 33. Thus <hi>Mary</hi> ſate at Jeſus feet and heard his Word, <hi>Luk.</hi> 10. 39. great <hi>Naaman</hi> will learn good from a little Maid. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 5. 2, 3, 4. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Bring along with you a bored ear, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40 6. and a bowing heart, as <hi>Samuel,</hi> ſpeake Lord for thy Servant heareth, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. 10. as <hi>Saul</hi> ſaid Lord what wilt thou have me to do, <hi>Act.</hi> 9. 6. In a Word pray to God, that all this may be done that he would bleſs the Word, both for the killing of Sin, and the quickening of grace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Do you beg a bleſſing on the food of your body and not of your Soul, <hi>Prov.</hi> 2. 3, 5. cry after it, this is your life, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. 4. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 38. 16. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 63.</p>

The ear is the ſenſe of Faith, as the eye is the ſenſe of love; Faith comes by hearing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 17. God makes the ear to be the Organ of our Salvation (in working Faith by hearing the word) as it was the Inſtrument of our deſtruction, when our firſt parents lent their ear in liſtening unto <hi>Satans</hi> lies: the Milk of the word is not to go in at the mouth, but at the ear, the ear is the Inſtrument to take in God by, and not the eye, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33. 19. <hi>Moſes</hi> deſires to ſee Gods glory, <hi>Ver.</hi> 18. no (ſaith God) I will proclaim it, and accordingly he doth ſo, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. 6, 7. and thus likewiſe God doth teſtify to <hi>Elias</hi> in a ſtill ſmall voice, (not in viſible things as fire and Earth-quake, but in a voice which is Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible) 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 19. 11, 12. both thoſe Inſtances teaches you, that teaching by a voice ſhould be the principal means, to bring your soul to the ſaving knowledge of God, <hi>Moſes</hi> thought that his ſeeing of God would much confirm him, (as <hi>Papiſts</hi> thinks of their ſeeing of Pictures and Crucifixes) but God Rectifies <hi>Moſes</hi> errour and proclaims himſelf, the Lord; Rectify the <hi>Popiſh</hi> miſtake alſo.</p>

Seeing, no not your ſeeing a man from the dead, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 27, 31. the <hi>Jews</hi> were ſo far from believing when they ſaw <hi>Lazarus</hi> raiſed from the dead, that they would have kill'd him, for no other fault, but becauſe he who had been dead, was alive again, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. 10. their ſeeing of ſuch an one was ſo far from working Faith in them, that it Tranſported them into fury; and into ſuch ſublime malice and madneſs, as to make them take up Arms againſt Heaven it ſelf, as ſeeking to kill a man, only becauſe God had made him alive. They liſtened as little to him whom they ſaw, as to Chriſt whom they heard, but ſought to kill [him] alſo, as well as Chriſt: Indeed who can believe the Teſtimony of a mere Creature, that will not believe the Teſtimony of the Creator himſelf. So that <hi>Hell</hi> is to be eſcaped by hearing, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 29. <hi>Eſay.</hi> 55. 3. <hi>Hear and live.</hi>

God may ſpeak once and twice, and man not perceive it. <hi>Job.</hi> 33. 14, 16. There be three vices in hearing which Chriſt muſt cure you of, before you can be attentive to the Word of God. (1.)

               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:93853:72"/>
A fleſhie excreſcence upon the drum of the ear, this muſt be removed to recover natural hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; ſo Carnal affections to the World will make you Spiritually deaf to the Word, until you be Circumciſed in ear, as well as heart by Chriſt. <hi>Act.</hi> 7. 51. <hi>Jer.</hi> 6. 10. Thus <hi>Herods</hi> carnality (with <hi>Herodias)</hi> made him deaf to Divine Doctrine, <hi>Mark.</hi> 6. 17, 18. (2.) There is abundance of bad humours in the brain, that make a noiſe within, ſo that a voice can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be heard without. <hi>Intus exiſtens prohibet Alienum.</hi> The head muſt be purged of thoſe Vapours before hearing can be quick, thus the heart muſt be purged of Pride, paſſion, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thoſe bad humours that deafs man to God: the <hi>Jews</hi> ears were waxen fat herewith, <hi>that they could not hear Chriſts voice, Matth.</hi> 13. 15. (3.) The Organ is ſometimes hurt by a fall: this is certainly done to the Inner-man, by the fall of the firſt man, our hearing is wounded till Chriſt caſt out the deaf Spirit.</p>

It finds and ferrets out ſecret Sins.</p>
            <p n="14">14. Hereupon muſt you, (1.)

            <p n="15">15. And (2.) you muſt attend it often, as often as you can redeem time from your other Employments, to embrace ſuch a bleſſed and golden opportunity: the Reaſon is, you will never find your heart in the ſame frame (at the next opportunity) that the Word left it in at your laſt audience of it. This is the diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the Miniſtry above all other callings in the World: a Miniſter of Chriſt never finds his work as he leaves it, the <hi>Carpenter,</hi> the <hi>Goldſmith,</hi> the <hi>Potter,</hi> (and men of all callings) find their work next morning as they leave it over-night; but a Miniſter of the Goſpel, doth not find the hearts of his hearers the following Sabbath, in the ſame frame as he left them in the foregoing: he ſent them away with warm hearts, but they return to him again with cold hearts; So that he hath a new fire to Kindle, his <hi>Iron</hi> to heat again before it will be Malle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the hammer of the word, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. 29. his wax (that is now grown hard by lying in the cold) to mollify again, before it will take the Impreſſion of the Divine Seal, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 17. therefore doth he pray for this before he Preach: you will aſſuredly and by woſul ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience

            <p n="16">16. Thirdly, you muſt attend the word without drowſineſs: if you ſleep at the word, the envious one will be ſure to ſow his tares while you do ſo; <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 25. Remember <hi>Eutichus, Act.</hi> 20 9. you may get a worſe fall then he did; you may fall from the high pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acle of profeſſion to the low Pit of prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, from the third Heaven, to the loweſt <hi>Hell,</hi> where you ſhall have no <hi>Paul</hi> to take you up and recover you: did you ever ſee a Man ſleep at his Markets, and ſo goe home empty, neglecting to buy the Proviſions (for himſelf and his Family) that he came thither for? Your errand to Gods Market for your Soul is (or ought to be) to buy the truth, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. 23. O go not home empty-handed, empty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted; did you ever ſee a man fall aſleep in taking and telling of <hi>Money's,</hi> ſuch an one cannot tell whether he take right <hi>Money,</hi> or

wrong, and is eaſily Cheated. Yet alas, how many by ſo doing put an everlaſting Cheat upon their own Souls, falling not only into a natural, but alſo into a Spiritual ſlumber while they are talking and telling of Divine truth, which is the only Currant Coin in the Court of Heaven.</p>
            <p n="17">17. Alas poor Soul, if you do ſo, I cannot ſay of you; as Chriſt once ſaid of <hi>Lazarus, (Joh.</hi> 11. 12. If he ſleep, he ſhall do well) but the contrary, if you ſleep in an Ordinance, you both do, and will do, very ill; you can neither take nor tell [even] ſaving truth when it is told out to your hand and to your heart.

But you will ſhame your ſelf, and deſpiſe the Church of God. Shall I praiſe you in this?

Spare-diet on that day is a good <hi>Antidote</hi> againſt that evil, and ſure I am, a truly thirſting Soul, that followeth hand after Chriſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63. 1, 2, 8. hath the right Spiritual <hi>Antidote</hi> (as ſpare-diet is the natural) againſt it. Such as wake much in <hi>Taverns</hi> and <hi>Ale-houſes,</hi> will be ſure to ſleep much in the

Ordinances, and they that dare do ſo, and can be pleaſed with themſelves in ſo doing, may juſtly ſuſpect their own ſtate and ſtanding God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. Such as ſleep to God, God will ſleep to them; and 'tis juſt (ſaith Mr. <hi>Robert Bolton)</hi> that ſuch be plagued with ſome ſudden ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance from Heaven, for neglecting ſo great Salvation, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 2. 3. to become Examples to others: 'Tis Gods great mercy, Gods plagues are ſuſpended.

            <p n="18">18. Fourthly, you muſt attend the word without wearineſs, as well as without drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, thoſe two very often go together. If <hi>Nero</hi> were ſo angry with <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> for being weary of, and falling aſleep at his Muſick; O what will the great God be, if you both be weary of, and fall aſleep at his ſacred Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance: you muſt ſhake your ſelf from ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſhneſs as <hi>Sampſon</hi> did, <hi>Judg.</hi> 16. 20. and not cry out, O what a wearineſs is it! <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 13. and when will the Sabbath be over, <hi>Amos</hi> 8. 5. as if in the ſtocks all the while you ſit there; but conſider how Chriſt ſtandeth and knocketh at the door of your heart (and this he hath done many days and weeks and mongths and years) yet is not weary, <hi>Revel.</hi> 3. 20. although the poſture of ſtanding be a weariſom poſture, and the action of knocking a weariſom action: yet his leggs ake not with ſtanding, nor his hands wearied with knocking, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 59. 1. ſhall

You ſhould come to an Ordinance, juſt as <hi>Behemoth</hi> came to <hi>Jordan</hi> in his thirſt, <hi>Job</hi> 40. 23.

24. In a word, Sixthly, to hear with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, is to have your heart affected with that you hear, ſo as it may not only burn in your heart as theirs did, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 32. but alſo melt kindly under it, as <hi>Joſiahs</hi> tender heart did at the hearing of the Law. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 34. 27. yea and rejoyce greatly when you are made to underſtand it, as the people did, <hi>Neh.</hi> 8. 12. your heart leaping within you at it, as the Babe ſprang in <hi>Elizabeths</hi> womb when (not the Lord himſelf, but, The Mother of our Lord ſpake to her, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 41. not only hear, but feel Gods voice, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 1.

            <p n="25">25. The third particular is, retention of memory, the Word. 1. It muſt be laid up in the head; you hear muſt not be like breath upon ſteel, that is ſoon on, and as ſoon off again: nor as day flies (call'd <hi>Ephemerae)</hi> that are bred at noon and dead at night.

If you cannot ſtay it, but it will go away; then pray, that however ſome <hi>Manna</hi> may ſtill remain, as <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. 14, 15. the <hi>Manna</hi> did come down with the dew. <hi>Ver.</hi> 13. Chriſt (that bread of life, <hi>Job.</hi> 6. 32.) comes down in the Miniſtry of the word, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110. 3. the dew covered the <hi>Manna,</hi> hence is that promiſe of hidden <hi>Manna, Revel.</hi> 2 17. when the dew was gone the <hi>Manna</hi> remained for the people to gather, O get an <hi>Omer</hi> full of this Angels food, put it into the Golden Pot of a Sanctifyed memory, and lay it up before the Lord. <hi>Ver.</hi> 33. 34. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 4.</p>
            <p n="26">26. You muſt (with <hi>Mary,</hi> Luke 25. 51.)

You muſt treaſure it up there, till it be kindly wrought upon your heart and become an Engrafted Word, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 21. till you have an Inclination to it, and a delight in it, when it Incorporates and becomes one with you and you with it. Thus the Word muſt Sink as well as Swim, 'tis not enough that it Swim in the head but it muſt alſo Sink down into the heart: God promiſeth to give an heart to know him, <hi>Jer.</hi> 24. 7. <hi>in that New Covenant,</hi> 'tis not head to know him, though the head be the ſeat of notional knowledg, yet the heart is the ſeat of that which is practical and experimental. The ſeed of the word abideth, 1 <hi>Job.</hi> 3. 9. only in honeſt and good hearts, <hi>Luke</hi> 8. 15. there be three bad ſorts of hearers to one good; how oft doth <hi>Satan</hi> (that Prince fowle of the Air) pick up that ſeed, which is ſown on the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of the head, and not in the heart.</p>
            <p n="27">27. None ever (that was wiſe) went to the Well, for a Pitcher of Water to ſpill it by the way; Jewels are to be lock'd up carefully,

The <hi>Samaritan Woman</hi> went to the Well for water to carry it home, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 7. and <hi>Ruth</hi> gleaned in <hi>Boazs</hi> field to carry home to her aged Mother at Home, <hi>Ruth</hi> 2. 19. Is the Lord kinder to you then <hi>Boaz</hi> was to <hi>Ruth,</hi> who let her glean among the ſheaves, and bid his ſervants let fall handfulls on purpoſe that ſhe might gather them. <hi>Ver.</hi> 15. 16. be ſure you beat out what you gather of the Corn of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and carry it home with you, and Scatter it not by the way, our Memory muſt not be as the Sieve or broken Veſſel, that lets all the liquor of life run out: if it be ſo naturally and in Worldly things as well as Heavenly; yet know for your Comfort, the oftner that the Veſſel hath water in it (though all the water run out) yet it leaves the Veſſel cleaner then it found it. A retentive faculty is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to an healthful body, until there be a due ſegregation, and no leſs is it neceſſary to an healthful Soul: yet muſt not your memory be as the Spunge to ſuck up puddle-water as well as pureſt Wine; but rather like the Fan that blows away the chaff, while the ſolid Wheat abideth; and like thoſe in <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 48. you muſt gather the good fiſh into this Veſſel (of

Sing not at all in that Month. The Saints of the moſt high God, ſhould rather be as the Canary-Birds that warble out their pleaſant Notes, all the Months of the Year; ſeeing the time of the Singing of Birds is come upon them. And they are made able to ſay (in the witneſſings of the Holy Ghoſt. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 1.) that their Sins are pardoned, their perſons are accepted off, and their names are writ in the Lambs Book of life. This is the true Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing time and they ſhould rejoice in this, <hi>Luke 10. 20. and rejoice evermore. 1 Theſ.</hi> 5. 16. yea in every thing give thanks. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4 4, 6. always warbling out the high praiſes of the moſt high God which is ever comely for the upright. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33. 1.</p>
            <p n="8">8. The Method of my diſcourſe upon this Subject ſhall (in Gods ſtrength) be thus man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged. 1. In ſhowing you the grounds, reaſons and Arguments (at leaſt ſome of them) that may be alledged for it. 2. The Anſwers to thoſe Objections that are uſually urged againſt it, and of both briefly. Firſt of the firſt of thoſe. The firſt Argument to enforce this Religious duty is taken from the Divine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, all Divine Worſhip muſt have a Divine Warrant this is <hi>(principium eternoe Veritatis)</hi> a maxim of everlaſting truth, and will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail againſt all contrary aſſertions: And aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly there is no duty (next to Prayer) that is more preſſed (both in the old and New
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:93853:81"/>
Teſtament) by the moſt (holy) God, although it be ſo little practiced by <hi>(Sinful)</hi> Man. But waving the old Teſtament precepts (which are liable to more exceptions) the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment precepts are moſt cogent, and they are principally three. <hi>(Eph.</hi> 5. 19. <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 16. and <hi>Jam.</hi> 5. 13.) that in the mouth of three Witneſſes this great truth might be eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The ſecond Argument, is taken from Divine preſidents, (waving the Old-Teſtament in this alſo) as before in Divine precepts; and they are three likewiſe. as <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 30. <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 25. <hi>&amp;</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 15. The Example of Chriſt (himſelf) is the <hi>(Regula Regulans)</hi> rule ruling, and the example of the Apoſtles is the <hi>(regula Regulata)</hi> rule ruled. You cannot Write after a better Copy, then after Chriſt, and after his Apoſtles ſo far as they followed Chriſt. His Pattern is for your Practice, and he will not be a Saviour to you for happineſs, unleſs he be alſo a Samplar to you for Holineſs; you muſt either tread in his ſteps here in this world, or you ſhall never lodge in his boſome in the World to come; and you ſhould follow them, who through faith and patience do now In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the promiſes. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 12. Follow the white-ſide (though not the dark-ſide) of this cloud of Witneſſes. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 1.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The third ground is Antiquity, pure An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity. This may give light, when all other
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:93853:82"/>
lights are out; the laudable and comely cuſtoms of the primitive Church ought to be obſerved, 1 <hi>Cor. 11. 16. as Water the neerer that it is to the Spring, the purer doth it run in the ſtream,</hi> ſo is Antiquity in cuſtoms, the neerer to the Apoſtles times, before the man of Sin aroſe to fowle them with his fowle foot, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34. 18. <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 1. the purer they are and ſo are juſtly deſerving a due eſteem and diligent peruſal in matters of fact, which (they) muſt needs know better then others after them. 'Tis true, the univerſal practice of Churches is no Rule; for the word of God is the only rule, and cuſtom, without truth is but a mouldy Errour, and as a Cipher without a figure: yet when the cuſtomes of the Church are backed with both Divine precepts and Divine preſidents, It ſhould ever ſtrike a Reverence upon the heart; Gods word is truth. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 17. and 'tis that which muſt inſtitute all Ordinances; ſuch cuſtomes, as hold not a conſonancy to the word, are vain. <hi>Jer.</hi> 10. 3. and ought to be aboliſhed: but in the duty of Singing cuſtom and truth meets together, 'twas the practice of him that was truth it ſelf; and <hi>(primum Cujuſ<expan>

Chriſt was firſt in this Goſpel-Ordinance, and the Primitive Churches followed him herein, as <hi>Juſtin Martyr, Tertullian,</hi> and others teſtify, having their <hi>(Cantus antelucanos)</hi> Singing praiſes to God and Chriſt before day.</p>

               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:93853:82"/>
5. The fourth Reaſon for reviving this Goſpel Ordinance, is the univerſal Obligation that lyeth upon all to performe it. 'Tis a natural duty (as well as inſtituted and moral duty hence all lys under the Obligation of it. Even all Creatures that receive mercy from God, ſhould return duty to God; let every thing that hath breath praiſe the Lord, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 150. laſt. to wit, in their kind and after their manner; yea the whole Creation, all the works of God (whether <hi>Reptilia, Aquatilia terreſtria ceu Coeleſtia,</hi> creeping things, Fiſh, Fowle, Beaſts below, and Stars above) ſhall praiſe God. <hi>Pſal. 145. 10. all joins in conſort with the Saints in praiſing work.</hi> 'Tis indeed chiefly Mans work as he is Gods Maſter-piece, and endowed with both Speech and Reaſon above other Creatures. Yet 'tis not Mans duty only, though it be (his) chiefly; all Creatures do owe an Homage of praiſe to their Creator, and all men may know either by the light of nature, that this duty is natural or by the Law of God, that it is moral (beſides what hath been ſaid of 'its Inſtitution in the Goſpel) 'tis pitty that Man ſhould rob God. Or as the <hi>Hebr.</hi> is, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 8. will <hi>Adam</hi> pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage <hi>Elohim?</hi> to wit, of his praiſe: and 'tis the greateſt pitty that this ſhould be done not only by <hi>Adam</hi> in general, but alſo by any of the beſt of the Sons and Daughters of <hi>Adam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:93853:83" rendition="simple:additions"/>
6. The fifth Argument is the Excellency of the duty above bare Reading: Singing the word of God in meeter, is fuller of Vigour and Spirit then Reading it in proſe, which of it ſelf, and in 'its own nature is a far more ſaint and ſeeble ſtrain, and hath not that ſweet delectation in it to the Godly mind, as frequent experience doth eaſily demonſtrate: how oft is a gracious Soul even elevated herein above it ſelf? thus <hi>David</hi> had his unſpeakable raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in this Ordinance, and therefore as being much vexed with his own natural dullneſs, he ſtirs up himſelf as <hi>Deborah</hi> had done before him. <hi>Judg.</hi> 5. 12. Awake <hi>Deborah,</hi> Awake, utter a Song. So he awakes his tongue (which he calls his glory) his harp and his heart too, for this duty wherein he found ſo much ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 57. 7, 8. <hi>&amp;</hi> 108. 1, 2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 104. 33, 34. <hi>&amp;</hi> 119. 103.</p>
            <p n="7">7 <hi>David</hi> did not only raiſe himſelf up from his indiſpoſing drowſineſs (going out with <hi>Samſon</hi> to ſhake it off from him, <hi>Judg.</hi> 16. 20.) but he reckons Gods ſtatutes (which he made his Songs in the Houſe of his <hi>Pilgrimage)</hi> to be better to him then thouſands of Gold and Silver. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 52, 54, and they were the rejoyſing of his heart, as his beſt inheritance. <hi>Ver.</hi> 111. <hi>Thus ſhould the word of Chriſt dwell in you Richly. Col.</hi> 3. 16. [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>] Indwell in you: It muſt be in you and in you again, well digeſted and turn'd into
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:93853:83"/>
juice and blood, and this cannot be ſo well effected by a bare and curſory Reading the Word, as it may be by Singing it; wherein there is a diſtinct and fixed Meditation upon it, and upon every Syllable of it while 'tis leiſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly founded out by the voice: the longer that you ponder it in your mind, the more likely may it have a ſtrong influence on your affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions; this pauſing and pondering doth chafe, ſupple and work the word into your Spirit, and ſo makes it both a refreſhing and a raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ordinance to you, having a more ſpriteful violence upon your heart then bare Reading; for hereby Gods word takes a deeper Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion upon you, and thoſe things that you did know before, come to be better known and more graciouſly underſtood, the Spirit of God Sealing them upon your Soul; then doth the word of Chriſt dwell in you Richly, and you give rich and liberal entertainment to it, and you will account all other but trivial traſh to this true treaſure.</p>
            <p n="8">8. The ſixth Reaſon to enforce this Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duty, is, as it is an Ordinance that is comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to Man (oft ſweetning his Spirit for God and Godlineſs) ſo it is an Ordinance very acceptable to God; not only <hi>Solomons</hi> Prayer to God, but alſo his praiſing of God had a moſt gracious acceptance with God. The fire that came down from Heaven upon his Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 7. 1. (as a viſible evidence of

            <p n="9">9. This duty hath ſuch acceptance with God that he hath put a double honour upon it, 1. In this World, 2. In the world to come. 1. Here God hath honour'd it with gracious

effects far above the reach of either Nature or Art in two things. (1.) In allaying the evil Spirit. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 24. The ſound of <hi>Davids</hi> Harp (which could not be available alone) was quickened with the ſpiritual Song (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the breathings of the Spirit were) theſe altogether made <hi>Saul</hi> well altogether.

            <p n="10">10. The ſeventh Argument for the ſinging-Ordinance, is, 'tis proſitable to the Church (as well as comfortable to Man and acceptable to God) in as much as it hath a greater Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion unto mutual edification in it, then in other Ordinances. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 19. ſpeaking to your ſelves herein, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 16. <hi>Teaching and admoniſhing one another hereby;</hi> this is done, not only as there is a perſonal performance of
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:93853:85" rendition="simple:additions"/>
every ones part in this duty (above others) but alſo as there is a ſhoring up of one anothers Spirits and Affections in it; like City-build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings that bear up one another; not like thoſe in the Country that ſtand alone and bear up themſelves upon their own ſingle bottom: beſides when this ſinging work is carryed on [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>] with joint conſent, this heaves upward every Petition more forcibly, and takes Heaven (as it were) by ſtorm and violence, eſpecially when Melody is made in the heart, which is the beſt Tune to every <hi>Pſalm.</hi> Can the roaring Boys of the World, ſtir up and provoke one another to Mad Merriments, among their Cups by their looſe and lewd Catches: and may not the Saints provoke one another, <hi>(Heb.</hi> 10. 24.) unto a Spiritual jollity (in a ſober ſenſe) to be expreſſed in <hi>Pſalms?</hi> When Spiritualized unto Spiritual Songs, this is good fellowſhip of the beſt ſort.</p>
            <p n="11">11. 'Tis pitty then, that this honouring God with our glory (as <hi>David</hi> that ſweet ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of <hi>Iſrael</hi> calls it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 57. 7, 8.) ſhould have ſo much diſhonour and diſgrace caſt upon it, either as to manner, or as to matter, either by thoſe that are good, or by thoſe that are evil. The <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Popiſh</hi> perſons do indeed deride us for ſinging <hi>Geneva Jiggs,</hi> (as they ſtile the ſinging <hi>Pſalms.)</hi> And others cry the duty down as a Novelty; whereas the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients tell us, that Chriſtians (in their times)
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:93853:85" rendition="simple:additions"/>
were wont to ſing <hi>Pſalms</hi> in their very jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyings. And that Maids and Servants made it their practice in their dayly work; aſſuredly the <hi>Devil</hi> would do to the Church now, as <hi>Balak</hi> (with (the <hi>Devils ſpel-man) Balaam)</hi> would have done to the Church in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, who, when he could not cut off the whole Camp of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> would be content to have part thereof curſed. <hi>Num.</hi> 23. 13. <hi>&amp;</hi> 27.

            <p n="12">12. Now to Anſwer the Objections which is the ſecond thing propounded; The firſt Objection is, that ſinging is comely for the upright only. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33. 1. So none elſe ought to Sing praiſes but they. Anſwer the firſt, the word (only) is not in the Text, and it may be duty in ſinners, as well as comely in Saints; 'tis true, high Speech ſo praiſe is, being the proper work only of glorifyed Saints, and of glorious Angels) becomes not a fool. <hi>Prov.</hi> 17. 7. Or a <hi>Nabal. Hebr.</hi> that is a ſapleſs or worthleſs fellow, in whom all true worth is withered; God likes not fair words that come out of a foul Mouth; why do ſuch take Gods word in their Mouth, when they hate to be Reformed? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. 16, 17. The lepers lips ſhould be covered according to the Law.
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:93853:86" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Levit.</hi> 13. 45. and <hi>[laudari ab illaudato]</hi> to be praiſed by a praiſleſs perſon is no praiſe at all. Chriſt ſilenced thoſe <hi>Devils</hi> that confeſſed him the Son of the moſt high God. <hi>Mark.</hi> 5. 7. <hi>Luk.</hi> 4. 41. O then rather cover your lips (with the leper) or reſolve to reform and let not your life give your lips the lie, be not as the <hi>Blacks</hi> that are white in the Mouth only.</p>
            <p n="13">13. The ſecond Anſwer to this firſt Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection is, all perſons (both Saints and Sinners) do lay under an Obligation to this duty (as it is both a natural and a moral or inſtituted duty, as before) 'tis a duty enjoined upon all, though all cannot perform this duty a like, and after a comely manner or with an Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Spirit. 'Tis true, the old heart cannot ſing the new Song. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 3 3 3. the new Song before the Throne, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 3. or the Song of the Lamb, <hi>Rev.</hi> 15. 3. <hi>For ſhould a man Sing a good Song with his Voice, and play a bad one upon his Inſtrument, it would make but an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful grating Noiſe:</hi> So it is with them whoſe lips and lives are not Relatives, and whoſe Actions contradict their ſayings and ſingings: yet every thing that hath breath, ſhould praiſe the Lord. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 150. laſt. and ſuch as cannot do, what they ought, they (reſolving to reform) ought to do, what they can; Seeing the poſitive command for this duty is general and univerſal: Sing to the
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:93853:86"/>
Lord, all the Earth. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 96. 1. and make a joyful noiſe, all ye Lands. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 100. 12. <hi>and Sing to the Lord, all ye Kingdoms of the World. Pſal.</hi> 68. 32. The duty is grounded upon the Soveraignty of God, as he is a great God and a great King above all Gods. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95. 3. and as his works of Creation and Providence, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth to all the Sons and Daughters of Men, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145. 6. to 10. Therefore the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers (and we with him) O that (All) men would praiſe the Lord for his goodneſs, and for his wonderful works to the Children of Men. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107. 8, 15, 21, 31. 'tis oft over again and again.</p>
            <p n="14">14. The ſecond Objection is, we may not Sing with a mixt multitude, that do but take the name of the Lord in vain; hereby we do but partake of their Sin, and ſo make it our own. Anſwer the firſt, when <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> Sang that Famous Song, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15. 1. there was not only a mixt multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude among them at that time (as is expreſly mentioned, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11. 4.) but alſo ſuch of the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that ſoon forgat the works of God, and tempted Chriſt in the Wilderneſs even of thoſe that Sang his praiſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106. 12, 13, 14. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 9. And the Song of <hi>Moſes</hi> (recorded in <hi>Deut.</hi> 34.) was appointed to be Sung by the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> not only in their upright ſtate, but alſo in their ſtate of Apoſtacy, that it might teſtify againſt them
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:93853:87"/>
as a ſtanding Witneſs. <hi>Deut.</hi> 31. 19, 21, 22, 29. even by ſuch it was to be Sung as <hi>Moſes</hi> knew would (after his death (corrupt themſelves ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly and the New Teſtament alſo,) <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 44.) tells you, that almoſt the whole City of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch</hi> (the greateſt part whereof were poor <hi>Pagans)</hi> came together to hear the Word of God, and though the Apoſtle managed the work both in praying to God, and in praiſing of God, yet may it not be cal'd confuſion, if the whole Aſſembly ſaid <hi>[Amen]</hi> to all. This ſaying <hi>[Amen]</hi> by the people gave their aſſent to both Prayers, and Praiſes. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 16. And was an univerſal acting perſonally in Gods worſhip, as well as perſonal ſinging is.</p>
            <p n="15">15. The ſecond Anſwer is, though Sinners (which drive the trade of Sin) do Sin in the manner of ſinging (becauſe they do it not after a Spiritual manner) yet they do not Sin in the matter of the duty, which is plainly Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory to all, though it be comely only in Saints: he doth <hi>bonum</hi> though he doth it not <hi>bene,</hi> and yet the Saints (themſelves may Sin in the manner of it too as well as ſinners, alas none of us know either how to pray, or how to Sing, but as the Spirit helps our Infirmities, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 26.) ſo as to ſing after a gracious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and to make Melody in our hearts to the Lord; and no ſufficient Reaſon can be rendred, why Saints ſhould diſcontinue their duties, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſinners do own God, and their own duty
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:93853:87"/>
(both by the light of Nature, and the Law of God) enjoined them. <hi>Paul</hi> both prayed and gave thanks to God in the preſence of them all. <hi>Act.</hi> 27. 35. even among poor <hi>Pagans,</hi> rude Mariners and Soldiers, that truſted to their own wiſdom more then to Gods word. <hi>Ver.</hi> 11. and that would have kil'd <hi>Paul</hi> not withſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all his kindneſs to them. <hi>Ver.</hi> 42. he doth not diſcontinuc his Devotion and duty upon the account of a mixt multitude; beſides God delighteth that his will ſhould be obeyed, and abhorreth that his Law ſhould be diſobeyed even by ſinful men, as in <hi>Sauls</hi> caſe. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 22, 23. and in <hi>Ahabs, 1 King.</hi> 21. 27, 28, 29. God knows how to allow yea and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward that which is his own, when yet he takes no pleaſure in the ſinful manner of the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of a Divine duty.</p>
            <p n="16">16. The third Anſwer is, there is a parity of Reaſon put upon both praying and ſinging, <hi>Jam. 5. 13. is any afflicted, let him pray, is any merry, let him Sing Pſalms.</hi> The ſtreſs of both thoſe duties lays not ſo much upon the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of man, as upon the commandment of God: and though ſinners cannot ſing with grace in their hearts, yet this excuſes them no more from ſinging then from praying, both which are alike general duties to all mankind and not peculiar to Saints: the very light of nature preſſed <hi>Jonahs</hi> Mariners to pray in diſtreſs. <hi>Jon.</hi> 1. 6. And the Moral precept that
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:93853:88"/>
forbids <hi>Atheiſme,</hi> commands Prayer which is an owning of God. He is <hi>Davids</hi> Atheiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal fool, that ſaith in his heart there is no God, and that calls not upon God. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14. 1. 4. Hence it is inferred, that though carnal, Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant or prophane people cannot Sing as they ought, no more can they pray as they ought; yet as this excuſes them not from praying work, neither can it from ſinging work; whatever is not done with Faith is Sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 23. and without Faith there can be no pleaſing of God. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 6. as to pray (ſo to Sing) without Faith is Sin, yet not to pray at all is a greater Sin; for the former is formality, but the latter is <hi>Atheiſme,</hi> which is the worſe of the two.</p>
            <p n="17">17. The third Objection is. Singing is but Temple-worſhip, and ſhould be aſſiſted with Inſtruments of Muſick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Anſwer the firſt, <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Deborahs</hi> Song was long before the Temple. 2. The Song of the Lamb, <hi>Rev.</hi> 15. Is taken out of ſeveral <hi>Pſalms.</hi> 3. Praying was Temple-worſhip and was attended with Incenſe there, as well as ſinging was with Muſical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments there; and ſo the Argument lays as ſtrong and as <hi>Cogent,</hi> for aboliſhing the duty of praying now, as well as of ſinging. 4. Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Inſtruments (then uſed) were only ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical, and ſo but temporary belonging to the Ceremonial worſhip and ſo is ceaſed, 'twas accommodated to the Church during her Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nority,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:93853:88"/>
               <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 1, 2. but ſinging with heart and voice is Moral-worſhip and ſo to abide among the mature heirs: the Ceremonial and Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous part of Temple-worſhip is done away, but the moral part (in ſimplicity and gravity) remaineth; and now no voice ſhould be heard in the Church but ſuch as is ſignificant, and is edifying by ſignification (which the noiſe of Inſtruments cannot be) 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 10, 11, 26. and in that Prophecy of the Gentiles Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95. <hi>We are commanded to make a noiſe with Pſalms but not with Inſtruments. Ver.</hi> 1. 2.</p>
            <p n="18">18. Briefly the fourth Objection is, but we are bidden to ſing the word of Chriſt, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 16. not the words of <hi>David</hi> now. Anſwer firſt <hi>David</hi> writ his <hi>Pſalms</hi> in the Spirit of Chriſt, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 2. the Lord (Chriſt) had ſpoken by the Mouth of his ſervant <hi>David. Act.</hi> 4. 23. 'Twas the Rock (Chriſt) that ſpake to and by <hi>David,</hi> and made him the ſweet ſinger of <hi>Iſrael, 2 Sam.</hi> 23. 1, 3. All the holy Scriptures (by which you muſt be guided here and Judged hereafter) is wholly the words that Chriſt hath ſpoken, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. 48. So that while you ſing the <hi>Pſalms</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>You do verily ſing the words of Chriſt.</hi> 2. Anſwer, the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Titles</hi> of <hi>David Pſalms,</hi> be <hi>[Miſimorim, Tehillim, and Shurim]</hi> which doth expreſly correſpond with the expreſs phraſe of the Apoſtle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 10. <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 19. <hi>Pſalms, Hymns,</hi>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:93853:89"/>
and <hi>Spiritual Songs;</hi> wherein he plainly points out the uſe of <hi>Davids Pſalms,</hi> as being alſo the word of Chriſt and richly ſuiting to all Conditions: and ſuch <hi>Pſalms</hi> which cannot be Sung as your Experience, yet may you Sing them for your Inſtruction. Divine truth is the ſame in Meter, that it is in Proſe, and may as well be Sung as Read. 3. Anſwer, Such <hi>Hymns</hi> as are compoſed by any now (ſuppoſe they be free from the raſh and raw Eructations of a private Spirit, which cannot edify as it ought, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 26.) yet as comming from an Ordinary gift only (for God no where promiſed another gift) it muſt needs (infin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itely) fall ſhort of thoſe Scripture <hi>Pſalms;</hi> eompoſed by the holy Pen-men of the Word, to whom the Lord vouchſafed ſuch an High Publick and Infallible Conduct, in Compoſing what was Conſigned to the uſe of the Church for ever; theſe muſt excel private <hi>Hymns,</hi> as much as the holy Scripture exceeds all other Books whatſoever.</p>

But here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he hath done well, to make a diſtinction 'twixt the two and the five; for as the two Fiſhes were things of Gods making, and the five Loaves were things of the Bakers making: So the two Sacraments (to wit, <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and the <hi>Lords Supper)</hi> are true, proper, and <hi>genuine</hi> Sacraments (Gods Creatures, and of Gods making as the two Fiſhes; but the other five (to wit, Confirmation, Pennance, Extrem Unction, Orders and Marriage) have the knavery of the Baker in them; made up more of courſe bran then of fine Meal.

Inſtituted by Chriſt, and not invented by <hi>Antichriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. The main and principal conſtitutive parts of a true Sacrament be three, to wit, <hi>[Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bum, Signum &amp; Signatum]</hi> the word, the Sign and the thing ſignifyed, (1.) There muſt be the word of Divine Inſtitution under the Covenant of grace; which yet is not the form of a Sacrament, but the efficient cauſe (inſtrumentally taken) by which God (out of his tender compaſſion to us) maketh for us a Sacrament <hi>[accedit verbum ad Elementum &amp; fit Sacramentum.]</hi> The word of Inſtitution comes to the Element, and makes it a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment faith <hi>Auguſtine.</hi> (2.) There muſt be the outward Sign ordained of God, and not to be altered or adulterated by Man; and when the inſtituting word is applyed hereunto, then doth it begin to ſignify truly to us ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is Divine and Heavenly, and that not of 'its own nature, ſo much as through the Ordination and Appointment of God. Thoſe are called Sacramental Elements, which do Sign and Seal the Covenant 'twixt God and Man. (3.) There muſt be the thing ſignifyed, to wit, the inward grace of Chriſt promiſed in the word to be annexed, to thoſe Sacred <hi>Symbols</hi> and ſigniſyed by them.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Thus the five <hi>pſeudonomous</hi> or Mock-Sacraments of the Romaniſts are Juſtly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded by Proteſtants, ſeeing they. (1.) Have
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:93853:95"/>
not any Divine inſtitution to make them Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Sacraments. nor (2.) Have they any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Sign ordained of God for them. nor (3.)

But the two ſtanding Goſpel Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, hath all thoſe ingredients and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting qualifications; as (1.) <hi>Baptiſm</hi> hath, (1.) An outward Element ordained of God, to wit, [Water] and (2.) A Divine inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by our Lord Chriſt, <hi>Math.</hi> 28. 19. and (3.)

            <p n="1">1. THoſe are the only Sacraments, which (we may ſafely ſay) did flow out of the ſides of our dear Saviour, <hi>Joh.</hi> 19. 3, 4. When his <hi>Pericardium</hi> was pierced by the Soldiers ſpear, (which nature hath filled with water to cool the heat of the heart,) there came out blood and water; and this the ſame <hi>John</hi> alludes to in his Epiſtle. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 6. when he ſaith that Chriſt came by water and blood; not by water only, but by blood alſo. Not only to teach us, that he juſtifies none by his merit, but whom he ſanctifies by his Spirit; (the grace of juſtification, held out in the blood, is always accompanied with the grace of Sanctification, hold out in the water) but alſo to ſhew, which be the two only Goſpel-Sacraments that he hath Ordained for, and beſtowed (as pledges of his love) on his Church his ſpouſe, that was taken out of his ſide alſo (as well as thoſe Sacraments) juſt as <hi>Eve</hi> was taken out of the ſides of <hi>Adam. Gen.</hi> 2. 21, 22, 23. The five <hi>Popiſh</hi> Sacraments came not
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:93853:96" rendition="simple:additions"/>
out of the ſide of Chriſt (as Sacraments for his bride) but out of the ſide of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> being his mere Inventions, and none of Chriſts holy Inſtitutions.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Thoſe two Goſpel-Sacraments Chriſt hath appointed the one for a Sacrament of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation; and the other for a Sacrament of nutrition. The former once only to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred to one and the ſame Subject, and the latter to be often according to the Inſtitution: and that of <hi>Auguſtin</hi> may paſs as a plauſible Reaſon, <hi>[Semel Naſcimur, ſoepe Paſcimur,]</hi> We are but once born, but we are often fed: feeding is a daily work, [as often] as ye eat this bread and drink this blood, ye do ſhow the Lords death till he come. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 20. Firſt of the firſt, to wit, <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> in the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral 'tis a fleeing from wrath to come, <hi>Math.</hi> 3. 7. And a running to Chriſt (as to a Sanct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uary) for Salvation from that wrath: the <hi>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus a quo</hi> or what is fled from, doth ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that there is a <hi>(terminus ad quem)</hi> or a City of refuge to run to for ſafety, <hi>Pro.</hi> 18. 10.

Hence the Phariſees are ſaid to Reject the Counſel of God againſt themſelves, and were <hi>[Ingrati gratioe Dei]</hi> as <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, ungrateful to the grace of God. <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 30.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Baptiſm</hi> doth alſo [now] ſave us ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 21. as the Ark did <hi>Noah</hi>
               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:93853:96" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and his Family, from that deluge of Divine wrath that deſtroy'd the old World.

This ſaveth, yet not as the efficient cauſe of Salvation, for that is Chriſt alone; nor yet as a neceſſary Inſtrument, for that is Faith alone: but only as a pledge of Salvation, and as a badg of the ſaved; you muſt look upon it as a ſpecial favour from God to you, that he hath given you this Goſpel Ordinance: and Secondly 'tis ſaid to ſave us (now) to ſhew the permanency of 'its uſe and efficacy, to that Soul which makes a believing uſe of it; 'tis effectual to Seal up Salvation whenſoever a man repents and believes. Hence <hi>Baptiſm</hi> is done once for all.</p>

'Tis that man only that is wakened out of his dream, that can tell his dream; So 'tis only he that is wakened out of his Sins, that can clearly confeſs his Sins in token of his true Repentance, and (2.) This confeſſion of Sin muſt have confuſion of Sin joined with it, otherwiſe all your words of confeſſion are but empty wind, and all your very tears of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition are but inſignificant water; not only the filthineſs of the fleſh muſt be put away, but there muſt be the Anſwer of a good conſcience too. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 21.</p>

            <p n="6">6.

            <p n="8">8. That the feed of believers (as well as believers themſelves) are the Subject of <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,</hi> I ſhall give you only a brief Landskip of thoſe Reaſons which ſatisfie me in it, omitting the common and voluminous Arguments that are uſually alledged for it.</p>
            <p>As firſt, <hi>Favores ſunt Ampliandi.</hi> 'Tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly more dangerous to narrow and ſtraiten the Favours of God to Mankind, then to overamplify them in caſes (that we may ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to be) dark and doubtful; 'tis moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that the Law was a grievous, and the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is a gracious diſpenſation, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 10. If the Moon light of the Law did lead into its Sacrament of initiation, both Parents and their Children, I cannot ſee Reaſon enough why the Sun light of the Goſpel ſhould exclude whom the Law received; ſeeing 'tis undoubtedly a more gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious (as well as a more glorious) diſpenſation, and that which hath a more liberal Proviſion of comfort in it, for all the Saints of God. Otherwiſe a believing <hi>Jew</hi> might juſtly object againſt the Goſpel, eſpecially having one Son before converſion Circumciſed; and another Son after converſion unbaptized, ſaying, if my ſeed be excluded by the Goſpel from the initi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:93853:99"/>
Seal which was admitted to it (as well as my ſelf) under the Law, then <hi>Moſes</hi> was a better Mediator than the bleſſed <hi>Meſſias,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as the Church-priviledges of the Law were larger, and more comprehenſive then thoſe of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p n="9">9. The ſecond Argument or Reaſon is, the bleſſing of <hi>Abraham</hi> comes on the Gentiles by the Goſpel. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 8. 14. with <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. 3. The Goſpel is the Promulgation of the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to <hi>Abraham,</hi> to whom the Goſpel is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſaid to be preached, even in the old Teſt. now the bleſſing of <hi>Abraham</hi> being to his ſeed as well as to himſelf, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7. Believing <hi>Gentiles</hi> muſt have the ſame priviledg, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the bleſſing of <hi>Abraham</hi> doth not come upon them, neither can they rationally be ſaid to have the priviledg of ſitting down with <hi>Abraham</hi> in the Kingdom of God, to wit, in the Church, as Chriſt ſaid they ſhould. <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. 11.</p>
            <p>The third ground is, Salvation and the way to it, is common to both <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile, Act.</hi> 15. 11. [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>] by the grace of Chriſt we ſhall be ſaved even as they; Hence 'tis cal'd the common Salvation. <hi>Jude Ver. 3. It follows then that the Jews were bound to underſtand, the Miſtery of their Legal Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, and to exerciſe Faith in them as well as we Gentiles.</hi> Yet (though Children then could not underſtand the Miſtery of their Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion)
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:93853:99"/>
were they not debarred from it on this account: ſo nor ours ought now from <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> of whom it may be ſaid as Chriſt to <hi>Peter. Job.</hi> 13. 7. what I do thou knoweſt not now, but thou ſhalt know hereafter why thou haſt been waſhed.</p>
            <p n="10">10. The fourth Reaſon is, <hi>Foederati ſunt Signandi,</hi> if Children have an intereſt in the Covenant, (which is the greater) then much more in the Seal of the Covenant (which is the leſſer) <hi>If the ſeed of believers be holy.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. <hi>And the Kingdom pertains to them, Mark.</hi> 10. 14. Why not the Seal of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</p>
            <p>The fifth Argument, can any man forbid Water that theſe ſhould be <hi>Baptized;</hi> which receive the holy Ghoſt as well as we, <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 47. a zeal in forbidding to Seal adoption to ſuch may be diſpleaſing to Chriſt, <hi>Mar.</hi> 10. 14. that they may receive the Holy Ghoſt as well as we. Firſt, there is no impediment on Chriſts part, for he bids them come. Secondly, nor on their part, for he faith, of ſuch is the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God. nor Thirdly, on the part of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> for it is a paſſive Ordinance as Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion was. That ſome Children did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the holy Ghoſt, appears from <hi>Jer.</hi> 1. 5. <hi>Jeremy was Sanctifyed in the Womb,</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 15. <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> was filled with the Holy Ghoſt even from his Mothers womb.</p>

               <pb n="170" facs="tcp:93853:100" rendition="simple:additions"/>
11. The ſixth Argument, <hi>Baptize</hi> all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. Includes Children, as go mark my Sheep, doth include that the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hard muſt mark his Maſters Lambs, as well as Sheep. As that in <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. 3. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 8. Includes young as well as old.</p>
            <p>The ſeventh Argument, Children may have the ſeed of Faith, as well as of Reaſon, before they can act or exerciſe it, and as in the womb they can neither take, nor chew meat but are nouriſhed by the Navel there, ſo <hi>Baptiſm</hi> may be a round goblet that wants not liquor. <hi>Cant.</hi> 7. 2. to nouriſh Children and new-born Babes, in the womb of the Church it may have in it Chriſts blood to juſtify, and his Spirit to Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy and cleanſe them from Sin.</p>
            <p>The eighth Argument, we may not damn all the ſeed of believers, and that in <hi>Mark.</hi> 16. 16. makes as much againſt their Salvation as againſt their <hi>Baptiſm;</hi> how can they be of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God (as above) and be ſaved but by the grace of the Covenant, as the want of underſtanding did not hinder Children, from the firſt <hi>Adams</hi> Sin, ſo neither did it hinder them from the ſecond <hi>Adams</hi> grace; and if they have both grace and glory, why may they not have that which Scals both.</p>
            <p>Briefly the ninth Argument, <hi>David</hi> had Faith for his Child. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 23, 24. that it dyed happily, for what comfort could it be to <hi>David,</hi> that he ſhould go to the grave unto it,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:93853:100" rendition="simple:additions"/>
he did believe it did belong to the Election of grace, otherwiſe he could not have been ſo comforted at its death.</p>
            <p>The tenth Argument, Chriſt loved his Church waſhing it with Water, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 26. Hence it muſt be ſaid, that either Children are not of the Church (whereof they were ever Members in the old Teſtament, and never repealed in the New) or that they may be waſhed with <hi>Baptiſmal</hi> Water.</p>
            <p n="12">12. Conſider alſo (with theſe Arguments) thoſe material things. As firſt it was the Red Dragon <hi>(Pharaoh)</hi> that would have hindred <hi>Iſraels</hi> little ones, from the Sacrifice of the Church in the Wilderneſs, <hi>Exod.</hi> 10. 8, 9, 10. <hi>(2ly.)</hi> God ſpeaks in great diſpleaſure againſt thoſe Men. (from their Children have ye taken away my glory for ever) <hi>Micah.</hi> 2. 9. <hi>(3ly.)</hi> God was angry with <hi>Moſes</hi> for neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting to Circumciſe his Child, <hi>Exod.</hi> 4. 24, 25. <hi>(4ly.)</hi> Parents do Covenant for themſelves and their Heirs, in Leaſes, and Deeds, and their Children have livery and ſeiſin of Copy-holds, according to the Cuſtom of the manor though they know it not. <hi>(5ly.)</hi> If unbelief broke off Children, as well as Parents, from the old ſtock. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 20. Then Faith may engraft in both again. <hi>(6ly.)</hi> As we find no expreſs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept for it, ſo nor any expreſs prohibition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, nor that any <hi>Baptized</hi> perſon kept their Children from it: the ſilence of the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:93853:101" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Scripture in it (which we are to admire and adore) makes it more probable: Chriſt gave no Rules, who to be <hi>Baptized,</hi> ſeeing the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon uſe among them had been to <hi>Baptize</hi> Men Women and Children, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 2. Hence the Jews do not Queſtion the action of <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing,</hi> or the Subjects of it in <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> but only his Authority. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 25. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo commonly known to them under the Law.</p>

Eſa.</hi> 29. 22, 23. Alas we ſail our Children herein, and undoes them and our Selves too.</p>
            <p n="14">14. All you that are <hi>Baptized</hi> (whether while young or when old or both) you muſt all know, that therein you have avouched the Lord to be your God (to walk in his ways and to keep his Commandments) and the Lord hath avouched you in that day, to be his peculiar People. <hi>Deut.</hi> 26. 17, 19. The moſt excellent and honourable name of Chriſt is then put upon you; O walk worthy of that worthy name, that the name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt may be glorifyed in you and you in him, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 12.

'Tis worſt of all to be in Gods Camp, and yet fight the <hi>Devils</hi> battels, and not Gods. This contracts more guilt then if you had never contracted with God to ſerve him at all.</p>
            <p n="15">15. Laſtly ſeeing 'tis more then probable that this great Ordinance (which came even out of the very ſides of our Lord Chriſt) turns to the leaſt account and advantage among pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of the Goſpel; the moſt part being not able to know the uſe and efficacy of it, when it is adminiſtred to them, and very few have any ſerious thoughts upon it (I fear) after the Adminiſtration of it. Therefore I beſeech all perſons to look back upon their <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> (whenſoever they were <hi>Baptized)</hi> and not only to make ſome penitent Reflections upon all your Sins paſt againſt your Covenant with God therein, but alſo ſome believing Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it, as a bleſſed <hi>Antidote</hi> againſt Sin for time to come. Thus <hi>Luthers</hi> brave Virgin
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:93853:103"/>
(forementioned) anſwered the Tempter (who tempted her to Sin) O <hi>Satan</hi> I call to mind that I am a Chriſtian and have been <hi>Baptized,</hi> and therein I Covenanted with my God, never to do ſuch things as thou Tempts me unto, and therefore I cannot, I dare not, I will not hearken to thy Temptations, which are ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to my promiſe and vow in <hi>Baptiſm;</hi> and hereupon the Tempter departed from her, having quenched his fiery darts with her <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſmal</hi> water.

            <p>Secondly, 'Tis an ineſtimable evidence of his favour to all his Redeemed. <hi>David</hi> could not expreſs his favour to <hi>Mephiboſheth</hi> in a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter way, then to make him Eat and Drink with him at his Table. 2 <hi>Sam</hi> 9. 5, 7. and 'twas an high favour to <hi>Chimham</hi> alſo; to be admitted to <hi>Davids</hi> Table, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19. 33, 35, 38. yet an higher favour and honor hath all the Saints. <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 30.

As it is a ſtanding evidence of tranſcendent affection, both of the Father in giving the Son to us, and of the Son in giving himſelf to us. 2.

ſuffering upon the Croſs, far beyond all Popiſh Crucifixes, it being of Chriſts own inſtitution. 3. As it is the neareſt Communion we have with God upon Earth, a ſitting down at the Kings own table (which earthly Monarchs practice not) as his Favorites and familiar Friends. And, 4. as it is a <hi>[Prelibamen]</hi> or foretaſte of that eternal banquet you ſhall hereafter eat off in your Fathers houſe, and therefore you may not ruſh into this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance (above all others), but prepare for it, as you would do for death itſelf: Caſuiſts ſay, <hi>Sacramentum &amp; Articulus mortis aquiparantur,</hi> you ſhould be as ſerious in your coming to the Lords table, as in your going (at the point of death into another world), in both you appear before the great God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Your preparation for this ſolemn Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance is held out in that Scripture-expreſſion, (the purification of the ſanctuary), 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30. 18, 19. which conſiſted of three parts: 1. Waſhing with water. 2. Changing their Garments. and 3. Purging out all leaven out of their Houſes to prepare for the paſſeover. If the <hi>Jews</hi> were thus zealous in the ſhadow and Ceremony, how much more ought Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ians to be in the truth and ſubſtance.

<pb n="184" facs="tcp:93853:107"/>
while you hide any of that old <hi>Leaven</hi> in any corner of your heart. There is (indeed) the <hi>Leaven</hi> of a corrupt Faith, of corrupt manners, and of corrupt nature: This laſt (which is as the fretting-leproſy, <hi>Levit.</hi> 14. 44, 45.) you cannot chide out of doors as <hi>Sarah</hi> did <hi>Hagar,</hi> but 'twill be a ruful inmate within you (making you cry O wretched Man or Woman, that I am. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 24.) So long as the walls of your Houſe of clay ſtandeth, and until the Stones and Timber be thrown down, it cannot be purged out; but the <hi>Leaven</hi> of corrupt Doctrin (which ſoures the whole Lump, or truth of the Goſpel) and that of a corrupt Communication, and Converſation (which ſoures both our ſelves and others with us) both theſe ſhould you (both) find out and caſt out, <hi>(Pſal.</hi> 34. 13, 14.) If not with as much Ceremony, yet with as much ſeriouſneſs as the <hi>Jews</hi> did their <hi>Leaven:</hi> The firſt <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Ceremony that carries reſemblance, was, the <hi>Jew</hi> began to purge within, and to baniſh all <hi>Leaven</hi> found within his own Houſe; It teachs you to mind within-doors-work, 'tis not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to purge your mouth and your hands, but eſpecially your inſide, your heart and not ſo much other mens as your own, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4. 14. your own Houſe and heart; the ſecond was, not ſo much as the leaſt morſel or crum of <hi>Leaven</hi> muſt be ſpared, which ſhows you, that you muſt account the leaſt Sin, both hateful to
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:93853:107"/>
God and hurtful to man, ſo it may not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged. The third Ceremony was, the <hi>Jew</hi> Searching the Houſe with a Candle and finding but a mite or crum thereof, in any corner by ſweeping (even) that little he carries out with great Solemnity: learn you hence, that a little poiſon is poiſon, ſweep every cranny of your Soul, your Conſcience, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 3. your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 5. your ſenſes. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1. 19. 37. your ſpeeches. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39. 1. that your whole Houſe may be poſſeſſed in holineſs and honour. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. 4. a little <hi>Leaven</hi> mars all. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 6.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The ſecond general is the true participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion after a due preparation: yet this you may know for your comfort, that your God will not ſtand exactly or Rigorouſly upon every circumſtance required in this purification of the Sanctuary, provided you prepare your heart with all your might, as <hi>David.</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. <hi>Ver.</hi> 1, 2. this is plainly taught you for your Encouragement, in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30. 18, 19. that where the heart is prepared to ſeek, and meet God according to our beſt endeavours, he will not inſiſt upon the exact purification of the Sanctuary, (which conſiſted on thoſe three parts aforeſaid) but will paſs by and pardon all our other weakneſſes and imperfections at the Prayer of his Vine-dreſſers, <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 7, 8. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 16. God will yield ſomething to their Prayers, even when he might come forth
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:93853:108"/>
in ſeverity againſt a perſon or people; happy are they then that have Praying vine-dreſſors ſet over them, ſaying with <hi>Samuel,</hi> God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid I ſhould Sin againſt the Lord ſo, as not to pray for you. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 23. and the good Lord pardon every one that is not ſo exactly prepared: in ſuch a caſe God accepts of the will for the deed. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 12. and looks more at the willingneſs of the offerer, then at the worthineſs of the offering; and you muſt put a difference betwixt, being unworthy and eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unworthily: all believers are (in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) unworthy of Chriſt and Salvation, yet being in Chriſt they are accounted worthy. <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 36. <hi>&amp; Rev.</hi> 3. 4.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Thus you, (1.)

Open the gates and the everlaſting doors of your Soul, that the King of glory may come in, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23. 7, 9. yet withal ſay, (4.) with the Centurion, Lord I am not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy that thou ſhould come under my roof, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. 8. nor am I worthy that I ſhould come to thy Table: and with <hi>Mephiboſheth</hi> (who was loved for <hi>Jonathan</hi> ſake as you for Jeſus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake)

wilt thou look (Lord) on ſuch a dead Dog as I am, ſo, as to let me eat bread at thy Table? 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9. 7, 8. O that you may trim your ſelf as he did to welcom hom ehis Lord the King. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19. 24, 25, 28. In this trembling frame muſt you draw near to the Lords Table, not approaching with a common Spirit, but well knowing that no other Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance is urged with that ſtrength and Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity as this is, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 29, 30. and no duty doth ſtrike ſuch a terrour upon the Conſciences of Men as this doth, inſomuch that even evil perſons do think they muſt be good at that time, and have then good words, good works and good Prayers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. There be three things eſpecially required of you in your participation of this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. Firſt ſelf-examination, there ought to be a ſearch as well as a Sacrament. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 28. (1.) Examine your ſtate as <hi>Lapidiſts</hi> do their Stones, that you put not an everlaſting cheat upon your own Soul; thinking your ſelf one of Gods Jewels when indeed you are but a Baſtard <hi>Diamond.</hi> (2.) Examine your wants, as coming to your Soul market, what Sin you have to Subdue, and what grace to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then; none goes to market, but they do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire what their Family-wants be. (3.) Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin your ſins, ſearch for them as the woman did for the loſt groat; ſhe ſought and ſwept, ſwept and ſought (with a Candle in her hand)
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:93853:109" rendition="simple:additions"/>
till ſhe found it, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. 8. you muſt take <hi>Davids</hi> Lantorn and Candle. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 105. and ſearch till you find all your Sins, ſaying to your own Soul (as <hi>Samuel</hi> to <hi>Jeſſe,</hi> are theſe all the Sons that thou haſt. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 12.) are theſe all thy Sins, if any one do not yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, ſit not down till that be fetched, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if it be a <hi>Mordecai Sin,</hi> that will not bow to Chriſt, or a <hi>Dalilah Sin,</hi> that hinders your Soul moſt from a Reſignation to Chriſt, (4.) Examin your graces as knowledg, Faith Repentance, Love, Zeal, Obedience, all thoſe ſhould be ready to wait on their Lord, their founder and their finiſher, bring forth your bravery to entertain Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="9">9. The ſecond thing required in the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, is ſelf-excitation, you muſt ſtir up your ſelf, as <hi>Deborah</hi> did; calling up her own Soul ſaying, awake awake, <hi>Deborah,</hi> awake awake, <hi>Judg.</hi> 5. 12. open there all the Springs of your Soul for Chriſt, as Chriſt opened all the veines of his heart for you. (1.) Open all your deſires and affections for him; come to this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, as <hi>Behemoth</hi> to <hi>Jordan,</hi> with a mighty and an all exhauſting thirſt upon you. <hi>Job</hi> 40. 23. bring ſtrong affections and a luſty appetite to this Supper, where 'tis a vertue Sublime to to be an holy glutton, and to drink hearty draughts of the blood of Chriſt, that you may go away from the Supper as Chriſt did from his <hi>Baptiſm;</hi> filled with the Holy Ghoſt,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:93853:109" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 16. you muſt conſider what is before you as <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. 1. but in that duty 'tis not your work to reſtrain, but to provoke appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, and the rather, becauſe Chriſt ſo exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly thirſted after your Salvation, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 50. though he knew it would prove ſo coſtly to him; Chriſt ſaith, with deſire I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to Eat this Supper with you, <hi>Luke.</hi> 22. 15. that had no need (for himſelf) of either you or it, how much more ſhould you ſay, with deſire I have deſired to Eat this Supper with Chriſt, who is at all the charges, pain, and pains himſelf and all for your Eternal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Secondly, excite and quicken up all your faculties, as the affections (thoſe hand maids of the Soul) give attendance to meet Chriſt (the miſtical <hi>David)</hi> juſt as the Virgins of <hi>Iſrael</hi> met literal <hi>David</hi> in their Singings and dancing. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18. 6, 7, 8. every one Singing their part appointed them accordingly [hope] is ſent out to wait for this King of glory, and if he come not [deſire is ſent out to fetch him, [Love, Delight, and Joy] receives and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains him, all theſe Virgins go out to meet this bleſſed bridegroom, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 1. having firſt ſwept the Houſe clear, and caſt all the filth away into the brook <hi>Kidron.</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30. 14. <hi>Math.</hi> 13. 14. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 21. and brought forth their beſt bravery, <hi>(Arras</hi> hangings, <hi>Perſian</hi> Carpets, rich ſtools, all their Plate and Jewels)
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:93853:110"/>
to wit, all the graces of the Spirit (far ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing <hi>Aarons</hi> rich garments that were for glory and beauty) all to prepare a large upper-Room for entertaining the King of glory: even ſo all the faculties of the Soul muſt be ſtirred up, to Improve their Intereſt in ſuch a bleſſed gueſt, as (1.) your underſtanding muſt look round about him, and behold him alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether lovely from this <hi>Sycamore-Tree,</hi> as <hi>Zacheus. Luke</hi> 19. 3, 4. <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 16. (2.) Your will muſt offer up both Sword and Keyes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As the Major doth to his Prince at his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment. (3.) Your memory muſt be ready to Regiſter every act of love to your Soul, remembring his loves more then Wine, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 4. In a word Chriſt muſt be led into every Room of your heart: and Laſtly all your graces muſt be excited, and made ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive [each] their Alms from Chriſts fulneſs, as ſaving knowledg, juſtifying Faith, ſincere Repentance, ſervent love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All come to touch him for healing vertue, well knowing that Chriſt comes with a Royal heart into the Soul to give abundantly and like himſelf, no mean gift can come from ſo noble an hand and heart, and that all this may be done you muſt uſe the third thing required, to wit, ſtrong Invocation; coming as a Prince to him <hi>Job.</hi> 21. 37. and begging his grace (in all) with your whole heart. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 58.</p>
            <p n="11">
               <pb n="191" facs="tcp:93853:110"/>
11. The third general is your Improvement after all. When Faith and all your other graces (together with your affections and the faculties, of your Soul) have plaid their part in the Mount, and brought you even to a Transfiguration, as was done both to <hi>Moſes</hi> and to the <hi>Meſſias, Exod.</hi> 34. 29. <hi>&amp; Luke</hi> 9. 29. then. (1.) You muſt tremble to loſe that luſter and glory that God hath put upon you by your converſing with him: If he hath made you one of his Jewels by communicating his preſence to you, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 17. then ſhine as a Jewel in all your Relations, that all which ſee you may acknowledg you to be a ſeed, the Lord hath been bleſſing, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61. 9. (2.) Be thankful to your Lord for this ineſtimable benefit, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116. 12. be of a rendring diſpoſition, and that in your life as well as with your lip. If <hi>Davids</hi> condeſcenſion to ſuch a dead Dog (as <hi>Mephiboſheth</hi> accounted himſelf) was ſo admired by him. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9. 7, 8. how much more by you that in rigour of Juſtice might be fed with Wormwood, and have the waters of gall to drink, <hi>Jer.</hi> 9. 15. yet the Lord gives you the fleſh of his own Son to be meat indeed to you, and his blood to be your drink indeed. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 55. that might ſay I will not feed you at all, <hi>Zech.</hi> 11. 9. (3.) Let it be an everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obligement on you, to keep far from every evil matter, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23. 7. The Oath of God (no leſs is a Sacrament) is upon you, lay Gods

            <p n="1">1. COnſiderations, and 2. Directions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in and after it. 1. Conſideration, Remember to keep holy the Sabbath-day, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 8. you muſt firſt Conſider the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of it. Before the fall (when Mans nature was pure) that the Lord God gave Man but one Commandment, to wit, that of not eating the forbidden Fruit: but after the fall (when Mans nature was defiled) God gave him ten Commandments, and thoſe moſtly prohibitive to ſtop his proneneſs and ſtrong Inclinations unto evil: The firſt of the tenth doth teach you the Object of Worſhip; The ſecond, the matter of Worſhip the third,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:93853:111"/>
the manner of worſhip (both of outward and inward worſhip in all theſe) as the fourth teaches you the time of worſhip, inwardly and outwardly alſo. The time of worſhipping God, is not left to mans own liberty, for then the looſe heart of man would keep no time at all, though time of worſhip (as well as, that God is to be worſhipped) is <hi>[Juris na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalis]</hi> written on the Tables of mans heart, yet one of ſeven is <hi>[Juris poſitivi]</hi> and written on the Tables of ſtone; both which are the Writings and the workmanſhip of God, as <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 16. The fourth Commandment cloſes up the firſt Table. (1) As the moſt powerful means to keep all the three former, and (2) As it draws into one the whole worſhip of God: and [laſtly] as it makes Gods worſhip known to the World, which otherwiſe would not be ſo well known, as it is by keeping a day for it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Conſider ſecondly the Scituation of it, as the fourth Commandment is placed by God [himſelf] in the cloſe of the firſt Table, ſo likewiſe before the front of the ſecond Table; it ſtands in the midſt of both, to ſhow you, that the Obſervation of both Tables in the <hi>Decalogue,</hi> depends much upon the Sanctification of the Sabbath, which hath influence on both Tables; for as the immediate honour and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God (which is brought forth and ſwaddled in the three firſt Commandments)
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:93853:112" rendition="simple:additions"/>
is ſuckled and nurſed up in the boſom of the Sabbath; ſo the keeping of the Sabbath is the beſt expedient, and the moſt bleſſed help for the keeping of all the ſix following Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments; thus it appears, that the Sabbath is <hi>[caput &amp; Compendium Religionis, &amp; omnem Dei cultum in ſe Continet]</hi> 'tis the head and <hi>Epitome</hi> of all Religion, containing in it the whole worſhip of God, and the whole duty of man, reſpecting both his hollineſs to God and his righteouſneſs to men.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The third Conſideration is, the Influence of it; that Religion and the power of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs is, juſt as the Sabbath is, as the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Sabbath finds reception, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly doth true Chriſtianity decay or flouriſh in Perſons, Families, Towns, Cities, King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and Countrys. It decreaſes or increaſes juſt as the Sabbath is eſteemed, or diſeſteemed. This might be demonſtrated (without diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty) both by Scripture and Reaſon, or Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, as well as by Experience: moreover 'tis richly worth your Obſervation, that when the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> broke the fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment only in the matter of gathering <hi>Manna,</hi> the Lord taxeth them for the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all the Commandments, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. 28. becauſe he that makes no Conſcience of break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Sabbath, will not ſtick (when it may ſerve his turn) at the breaking of any other Commandment, he ſtands alike affected unto
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:93853:112" rendition="simple:additions"/>
all; the whole Law is but one <hi>Copulative. Ezek.</hi> 18. 10, 11, 12, 13. 'Tis like a Chain that is diſſolved by the looſening of one link; that an offence in one, makes guilty of all, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 10. <hi>All Sins flow from the ſame corruption as Temptation draws it out; he that breaks one (eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially this fourth) habitually breaketh all, not ſo Actually.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. The fourth Conſideration is, the ſtamps on it, that as the Sabbath is the Mother of Religion. So God hath put four Immortal ſtamps upon this precept that concerns it, above all the other nine precepts: as (1) It hath ſuch a Preface before it, as none of the other hath, to wit, [Remember.] (2) Whereas the other nine are delivered either negatively (as moſt of them are) or poſitively only. The fourth is delivered both ways. (3) Whereas the other Commandments are delivered to a mans perſon only <hi>[Thou</hi> and <hi>Thou.]</hi> This is not to our perſons only, but to our Families and Relations alſo. <hi>[Thou</hi> and <hi>Thine, Thou</hi> and all <hi>Thine.]</hi> (4) It hath more grounds and Reaſons alledged in it (to enforce the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of it) then any other precept, as 1. 'Its own Equity. 2. Gods bounty. 3. His own Example. and 4. The days benediction. Thoſe four Immortal ſtamps and Characters of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, you muſt neither forget nor neglect, much leſs the Sabbath, but remember to ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy it; the Gentiles as well as the <hi>Jews</hi> are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:93853:113"/>
to obſerve it, ſeeing the ground of it is general (to <hi>Gentiles</hi> as well as to <hi>Jews)</hi> and the Equity of it perpetual, for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration of Gods Creation of the World, and of Chriſts Redemption of it, have (both) an Univerſal and an everlaſting Equity in <hi>Them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Conſider fifthly, the ſenſe of its preface [Remember] imports three things: 1. The Antiquity of the command, (as 'tis ſaid in another Caſe, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 4. 22.) Theſe are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient things, almoſt as ancient as the World it ſelf, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 2, 3. and the ceaſing of <hi>Manna</hi> on the ſeventh day. <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. 24, 30. plainly ſhews, that <hi>[ab ipſius Mundi primordio inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luiſſet Sabbati Obſervantia]</hi> the Sabbath was kept from the beginning of the Creation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the promulgation of the Law at <hi>Sinai, Exod.</hi> 20. which was added, becauſe antient things are apt to wear out of the mind of Man; and the <hi>Devil</hi> had endeavoured to blot out the Remembrance of the Sabbath, and of the Creation in the long-lives of the <hi>Patriarks,</hi> that ſo he might Uſher in that fooliſh conceit of the Worlds Eternity, ſo cryed up by ſome Heathen Sages, though decryed and exploded by the wiſeſt of them. 2. It implies the weightineſs of the Command; 'tis not left either to your pleaſure, or to your leiſure, or liking, (as a frivolous or indifferent thing) that may admit either of a diſpenſation or a
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:93853:113"/>
diſcharge; but among all your other neceſſary duties, you muſt Remember this duty of weight and of great importance: and 3. It Imports mans proneneſs to forget it; ever ſince his memory was wounded by the fall, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is he oft call'd on to remember: Alas you will forget it (thinking yourown thoughts, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> before you be aware.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Conſider the morality of it: the fourth Command doth indeed conſiſt of ſome things Temporary and Ceremonial (and ſo by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence changeable) peculiar to the <hi>Jews:</hi> as (1) Not ſtirring out of their places, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. 29. (2) Not kindling of Fires, <hi>Exod.</hi> 35. 3. (3) Nor carrying burdens, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17 21. <hi>Neh.</hi> 13. 15, 16, 17. So likewiſe their Sabbath was (4) A ſign 'twixt God and them, <hi>Exod.</hi> 31. 13. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20. 12. and (5) In remembrance of their deliverance from <hi>Egypt. Deut.</hi> 5. 15. Yea (laſtly) there Seventh day was to be Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with ſeveral Rites. <hi>Num.</hi> 9. 10. all which are Typical, and ſo Temporary and Changeable; beſides all theſe appendices, there is another part of it which is moral and perpetual; as (1) That there ſhould be a day of Sabbatizing or Reſting [as the Word <hi>[Sabat]</hi> ſignifies,] (2) That this day ſhould be kept holy to the Lord; and (3) That a Seventh day ſhould be obſerved as an holy reſt, not this or that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Seventh day, but one of the Seven: For, 1. The preciſe time of the Seventh-day,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:93853:114" rendition="simple:additions"/>
from the Creation, is loſt by the Suns ſtanding ſtill in <hi>Joſhuahs</hi> days, and by 'its retrograde Motion ten degrees in <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> days, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 10. 13. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 38. 8. Hence ſome think that our Lords-day is the very ſame numerically with the Seventh-day, if ſo, then we keep Gods<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day commanded here.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Again ſecondly, as the Suns ſtanding ſtill and running backward made an alteration, in the courſe of the univerſe, and ſo did loſe [as to us] that preciſe computation of the Seventh day. So likewiſe, ſhould that preciſe part of 24. hours (from the Creation) of the Seventh-day belong to the morality of the fourth Commandment, then ſuch as Travel by Sea, either Eaſt or Weſt to ſuch and ſuch degrees, are obliged to Impoſſibilities; for by the diſtance of Climates, they may gain or loſe, half a day or a whole day, (as Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi> did, who putting a girdle about the World in his Sea-Voyage, though a critical meaſurer of time, yet through the Variation of Climats, loſt one day. <hi>(Fullers Holy State. Chap. 22. Book. 2. Pag.</hi> 128. In his life.) So that 'tis Impoſſible for them preciſely and punctually to obſerve that part of time. <hi>(3ly.)</hi> Neither is it ſaid in the fourth Command: [Remember to keep holy the Seventh day,] but 'tis ſaid, twice over, [keep holy the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-day] which doth not only reſpect the <hi>Jewiſh-Sabbath</hi> under the Law, but may alſo
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:93853:114"/>
have reference to the Chriſtian Sabbath under the Goſpel. The <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text may as well be read thus, Remember the reſting-day to keep it holy, [a ſeventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God.] So that he who Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to keep a Religious reſt weekly, is not breaker, but a true obſerver of the fourth Commandment.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Fourthly and laſtly, 'tis worth your ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation that the Seventh-day after the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not butted and bounded with the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and the Morning, as all the other ſix days are, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 2, 3. becauſe (as may be ſuppoſed) the time would come under the Goſpel, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Sabbath ſhould have a new beginning and a new ending, when all things were to be made new by Chriſt, <hi>Revel.</hi> 21. 5. and if all things, then (by conſequence) the Sabbath is made new by the Lord of the Sabbath, <hi>Mat. 12. 8. Mark.</hi> 2. 28. And hence is that new Sabbath cal'd the Lords-day, <hi>Revel.</hi> 1. 10. which very Phraſe Imports the Lords Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, as paralel Phraſes do (the Lords Supper, the Lords-Prayer, the Lords-Table) intimate that he Inſtituted all theſe. It being the manner in the Apoſtles-days to call all things [the Lords] rather then [Chriſts.] [<gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="200" facs="tcp:93853:115" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Lord, 'tis expreſſed by an Adjective poſſeſſive, as ſhewing the day to be a part of Chriſts poſſeſſion, not only as all other days are his by Creation, but this is his (more Emphatically cal'd ſo) by way of Conſecration and Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.</p>
            <p n="9">9. This leads to the ſeventh Conſideration, the Actions of it, that 'tis more then probable, Chriſt (himſelf) in his own Perſon was the Author and Inſtitutor of the Firſt-day. Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, ſuppoſing thoſe few things, which ought to be ſuppoſed: as (1) That Chriſts life was the light of Men, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 4. as he is the Object of your hope, ſo he muſt be the pattern of your holineſs; he will not be your Saviour for happineſs, unleſs he be your Samplar for holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs too, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 3. (as above) therefore he bids you learn of him, <hi>Math.</hi> 11. 29. <hi>[Imitari quem colimus eſt ſumma Chriſtianitatis.]</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to Chriſt (whom we Worſhip) is the very Sum of Chriſtianity, 'tis an Imitation of his Morals, though his Miracles and Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atory Actions are unimitable. Chriſt came primarily as the price of our Redemption, but ſecondarily as the pattern of our Sanctification, and ſo gave us an Example that we ſhould fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his ſteps. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 21. and he inſtructs us by his doing as well as by his teaching, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 1. [to do and to teach.]</p>
            <p n="10">10. The premiſſes being granted, that Chriſts [doing] inſtructs us as well as his
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:93853:115"/>
teaching, you will find this one of Chriſts [doings] to keep the firſt day holy (himſelf) after his Reſurrection; as he roſe again (after he had reſted all the <hi>Jewiſh Sabbatb</hi> in the grave) upon the firſt day morning; So he came the very next firſt day into the midſt of his diſciples (then Aſſembled,) <hi>Joh.</hi> 20. 19. and the very next firſt day (immediately after that) he came to them again alſo. <hi>Ver.</hi> 26. The like he did ('tis very probable) every firſt day during the 40. days he continued upon Earth between his Reſurrection and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion, becauſe the Sabbath-day (being alſo the firſt day of the week) the Apoſtles ſtill kept their holy Aſſemblies, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 1. and then was the holy Ghoſt given to them. The (2) thing to be ſuppoſed (briefly) is, that Chriſt taught his Diſciples the obſervation of the firſt day-Sabbath, not only by his appearing once and again to them on this day in a Solemn manner, and thereby approving of their meetings on that day, but alſo by his ſpeaking to them of the things pertaining to the Kingdom of God, (all the 40. days of his abode on Earth with them, no. conſtantly but by intervals on each firſt day,) <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 3. and ſurely this great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern of the time of worſhip muſt needs belong to the Kingdom of God. The (3) thing to be ſuppoſed is that Chriſt is as faithful as <hi>Moſes,</hi> who ordained all things generally neceſſary and profittable for the Church, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 2. and
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:93853:116" rendition="simple:additions"/>
no leſs can be the obſervation of the Sabbath, ſo needful as above.</p>
            <p n="11">11. The eighth Conſideration is, the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for it. The many Arguments for the Firſt-day-Sabbath, which for brevities fake I ſhall here but name. as (1) Chriſts own pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern, as above. So (2) the Apoſtles practice, whom undoubtedly Chriſt inſtructed, (during the 40. days) in the change of legal Sacrifices, Sacraments, and Miniſtry into Evangelical (as all grant) and why not of the <hi>Jewiſh-Sabbath</hi> into the Chriſtian, ſince there is the ſame Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; otherwiſe the Apoſtles would not have kept their Solemn meetings on the firſt day, as they did, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2. 7. (the Apoſtle being at <hi>Troas</hi> ſeveral days might have kept any of the ſeven-days, yet pitches on the firſt day for Prayer, Preaching, and Celebrating the Lords Supper,) 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 2. As Chriſt is the Rule Ruling, ſo the Apoſtles are the Rule Ruled, and we ſhould follow them as they followed Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 1. The (3) Argument is the precept of the Apoſtles (as well as their practice.) They did not only obſerve it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but they alſo preſcribed it to others, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 9. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 2. [Every firſt day, <hi>&amp;c.]</hi> Which implys, (1) That their Solemn meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were on the firſt day. (2) That this day was well known among Chriſtians for their meeting day, this Epiſtle being writ to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> about 23. Years after Chriſts death,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:93853:116"/>
(3) This day was injoined for ſuch holy exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes, as Collections uſually followed in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive times, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 42. (4) The word (every) ſhews 'twas no occaſional preſcription, but a perpetual Ordinance, and (5) Ordained to be obſerved in all the Churches, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 17. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 23. Beſides [<gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>] the Lords-day is added in the old <hi>Greek-Copy,</hi> as <hi>Beza</hi> wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth, on 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 1. [<gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>]</p>
            <p n="12">12. The fourth Argument is, from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion or equality of honour due to Chriſt with the Father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 23. The Son muſt be honoured equally with him, and 'tis no Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 7. As the Father hath been ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured with the Seventh-day Obſervation (his reſting day) from the Creation to the Redemption of the World. So the Son muſt be honoured from thence to the conſummation of the World with the firſt-days obſervation, which was his reſting day. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 10. and that from a greater work, as <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. 7, 8. other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe there would be no equality: The (5) Argument is, the prophecies of the old Teſt. that the Sabbath of the new Teſt. ſhould be on the firſt-day of the week; as the Inſtitution of Circumciſion on the eighth-day, the <hi>Pſalms</hi> [on <hi>Shemineth]</hi> or eights, and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110. 3. with 118. 24. <hi>Math.</hi> 21. 42. <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 11. ſpeaks all of this day as the latter Scripture expounds the former, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The (6) Argument is, the prerogative of this day above other
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:93853:117"/>
days, as on this day, (1) The light was Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and the Angels of Light alſo, (2) <hi>Iſrael</hi> went through the Red Sea. Ancients ſay (3) God fed them with <hi>Manna,</hi> (4) Alſo on this day the ſtar appeared to the wiſe men, and (5) That Chriſt fed 500. with 5 Loaves, and (6) Was Baptized on it, however roſe upon it, And (7) is Gods Judgments upon profaners of it, and the (8) The conſtant and continued cuſtom of the Church to keep it, in all ages ſince Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="13">13. The ſecond thing (after the pregnant conſiderations) is the practical and profitable Directions, how the Chriſtian Sabbath may be Sanctified ſo, as to bring a Spiritual bleſſing into the Soul. The firſt Direction: prepare to meet your God, O Chriſtian, <hi>Amos</hi> 4. 12. there is no work (either Natural or Artificial) but it requires preparation, how much more this Religious work! the Husbandman pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares for his Husbandry, and the Muſician for his Muſick, and ſhall not you [that are part of Gods Husbandry, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 9.] have your Soil prepared for the Celeſtial ſeed. O pray to the only preparer of hearts. <hi>Prov.</hi> 16. 1. to the skilful Muſician, that he may tune your harp (your heart) to Sions Songs, and Sabbath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervices, that you may make melody there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with and therein to the Lord, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 19. The ſecond Direction is, ſet ſome time apart (at leaſt) the evening before the Sabbath to
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:93853:117" rendition="simple:additions"/>
trim your Lamps for meeting your Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom, <hi>Math.</hi> 25. 7. The Traveller makes all ready over night for his Journey intended next morning; and that Oven which is heated the night before, will be the ſooner fitted for ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in the following day: the <hi>Jews</hi> had their preparation for the Sabbath the evening before it, <hi>Mark.</hi> 15. 42. <hi>Joh.</hi> 19. 31. their prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Sabbath began at three a Clock in the afternoon, having <hi>[Sabbatulum ante Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bathum]</hi> afore Sabbath, before the Sabbath. Thoſe of <hi>Tiberias</hi> began the Sabbath ſooner then others, as thoſe of <hi>Trephore</hi> continued longer, laying down this as their Rule (as <hi>Buxtorf</hi> relates) <hi>Tutius eſt tollere de profano &amp; addere ad Sacrum, quam tollere de Sacro &amp; addere ad profanum;</hi> 'Tis ſafer to pinch a part of the week-day, than the leaſt part of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-day.</p>
            <p>Our own <hi>Chronicles</hi> tell us, that the <hi>Saxons</hi> (in thoſe dark times) were ſo devout, as not to allow their ſecular affaires to entrench upon their Sabbath-days Devotion, and therefore began their preparation at three in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon on the laſt day of the week; inſomuch that our forefathers at the Ringing of the Bell to Prayer at that hour, the Husband-man would give over his labour in the Field, and the Tradeſ-man his work in the Shop, and ſet themſelves to prepare for the Sabbath: <hi>Clarks, Engl. Martyr.</hi> Pag. 30. Tells of <hi>Edgars</hi> Law
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:93853:118" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to this purpoſe. And <hi>Tacitus</hi> ſaith <hi>[Nox diem ducere videtur]</hi> the night ſeems to lead the day, as the evening, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. is (all along) ſet before the Morning, and therefore the evening before muſt belong to it. O how the Devotion of thoſe dark days condemns the Indevotion of our (more knowing) times, wherein Men are ſo far degenerated from their Aunceſtors Zeal, that they dare entrench upon the holy time, either in worldly works or in fooliſh games, as if the waters of the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary (that full-Sea of knowledg promiſed, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 11. 9.) had extinguiſhed the fire of the Sanctuary, to wit, that former Zeal and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent devotion in Solemnizing Gods Sacred Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath in the entire extent of it. ☜ I the longer inſiſt upon this ſecond Direction, becauſe uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, as men meaſure to God in preparation, God remeaſureth to men in performance of his bleſſing: I have found my beſt Prognoſticks about what communion with God I ſhould enjoy on the Sabbath-day, from the Divine influences I have had upon my heart the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before.</p>
            <p n="15">15. The third Direction is, Remember, not only to prepare for it, but alſo to long after it, as a day of deſires to your Soul, the preface (Remember) ſpreads it ſelf over all the duties of the Sabbath, before, in and after alſo: <hi>Druſius</hi> tells of an holy <hi>Jew</hi> that would uſually go out early in the Morning of the Sabbath,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:93853:118"/>
and having put on his beſt Apparrel would, cry out <hi>(Veni ſponſamea)</hi> come my bleſſed Bride, thou art welcom; as being exceeding glad of 'its comming. If you, (with the Mariner) have lanched out your heart (the Ship) out of the Haven of Worldly mud over night, you will long for the Morning, (as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130. 6.) to hoiſe up Sail for your Voyage to the Cape of good Hope, and you cannot then but riſe early as <hi>Iſrael</hi> did in their Siege of <hi>Jericho</hi> upon the Sabbath day. <hi>Joſh.</hi> 6. 15. have not you the ſtrong holds of Sin (as they had the walls of <hi>Jericho)</hi> to batter down. O long for this Queen of days (as the Antients cal'd it) for your Souls market-day, having caſt up all your Spiritual wants overnight. Say with <hi>David,</hi> my Soul longeth, yea even fainteth for the Courts of the Lord, O when ſhall I come and appear before him, <hi>&amp;c. Pſal.</hi> 8. 42. <hi>&amp;</hi> 63. 1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 42. 1, 2.</p>
            <p n="16">16. The fourth Direction is, Improve every part and parcel of the Lords Sabbath for your Souls edification and advantage (either pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly, or privately) in holy and Religious exerciſes; the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word <hi>(Shamer)</hi> to (keep) the Sabbath, ſignifies ſuch a careful and diligent keeping, as is that of Gold or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious things, which a man would not loſe any part or parcel of: how careful is the Gold-Smith of keeping the very filings of his Gold, and the Apothecary (in his beating of Pearl to
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:93853:119"/>
Powder) is extraordinary watchful, that the leaſt duſt of it fly not out of his Mortar; and why? Becauſe a little of ſuch things is very pretious and of great value: Thus the ſmalleſt part of this Holy-day is of great price, take heed of loſeing the leaſt moment of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Sabbath (one Inch whereof the Damned in Hell would give worlds for, if they had them) but improve the whole day for Gods glory and your Souls good. O then, that practice (of too many perſons in too many places) in making Gods Sacred Sabbath the very voider and dunghil for all refuſe-buſineſſes (putting them off to that day) muſt needs be a great provocation to the moſt high and holy God, 'tis a Scripture wonder, [will a man rob God? [or, <hi>Hebr.</hi> will <hi>Adam</hi> plunder <hi>Elohim?] Mal.</hi> 3. 8. Seeing the whole day is conſecrated both by God, and alſo (as <hi>Ananias</hi> goods) to God, it is dangerous to keep back any part of it for your own uſe, <hi>Act.</hi> 5. 1, 2, 5, 10. and not keep it wholly and (in every part of it) holy to the Lord.</p>
            <p n="17">17. The fifth Direction is, make this day a day of your delights, as before a day of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires; delight in the day, and in every duty of the day; account the Sabbath not only your duty, but alſo your priviledg, not only your work, but your wages too, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58. 13. Call the Sabbath your delight, and if it be not ſo, you may not call it ſo; ſurely it was not ſo to
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:93853:119"/>
thoſe Worldly wretches that cryed, when will the Sabbath be over, <hi>&amp;c. Amos</hi> 8. 5. as if they had been in the ſtocks, all the while they were keeping a Sabbath; The <hi>Greek</hi> word for delight is [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>] Septuag. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. 4. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which comes from the word [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>] that ſignifies Paradiſe, or place of pleaſure; to intimate, the Lord and his Sabbaths may not be as ſtocks to you, but as a Paradiſe, and a place of pleaſure; you ſhould take as much delight therein, as in walking the Round in the choiceſt Spring-garden. O how ſhould you bleſs God for the Sabbath, as <hi>Neh.</hi> 9. 14. and rejoice in it as in the day the Lord hath made (for Spiritual delight,) <hi>Pſal.</hi> 118. 24. counting it ſo, and making it ſo; not only a delight, but alſo holy and honourable and becauſe holy therefore honourable. O may you but be in the Spirit on this Lords day, (as <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 10.) and taſt how good the Lord is, <hi>(Pſal.</hi> 34. 8.) in the dainties of holy duties, and in his heart refreſhing and Soul-raviſhing Ordinances; you will find moſt incomparable pleaſure therein, and far-far exceeding all the dirty delights of ſenſualiſts and Sabbath breakers, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14. 10. <hi>Job</hi> 27. 10.</p>
            <p n="18">18. The ſixth Direction, be not weary of it before it be over. The whole Sabbath ſhould be ſpent without wearineſs, in works of Piety, mercy and neceſſity, and in none elſe; here's variety to prevent nauſeating in works of Piety
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:93853:120" rendition="simple:additions"/>
you may paſs from one Ordinance to another, (as the Bee flys from one flower to another) and not be weary; and from works of Piety you may go to works of Charity, and from thence to works of neceſſity for your own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural nouriſhment: O then, here is no need of crying out [what a wearineſs is it] as <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 13. or [when will it be over] as <hi>Amos</hi> 8. 5. as if in little eaſe all the while; Carnal hearts know not (indeed) how to wear out the Sabbath ('tis ſuch a wearineſs to them) and therefore they wiſh it over, full loth would they begg <hi>Davids</hi> office out of his hand (of being a door<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper in the houſe of God, who muſt be firſt in and laſt out,) <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84. 10. and what would they do to ſpend an everlaſting Sabbath in Heaven, that are ſo troubled and tyred with a ſhort one on Earth, not without a world of wilful diſtractions, but the Spiritual heart that is rapt up and raviſhed in Spirit, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 10. and is in the fear of the Lord (and in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of the holy Ghoſt) all the day long, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. 17. can wiſh with <hi>Joſhuah</hi> that the Sun ſtood ſtill on that day for more killing of Sin, and quickning of grace.</p>
            <p n="19">19. The ſeventh Direction is, be ſure you make it a right day of reſtraint to you, as it is called, <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 8. <hi>(Jomegnatſereth) diem In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdicti;</hi> a day of prohibition from all Improper work; the ſame word is uſed, <hi>Numb.</hi> 16. 48. and the Plague was ſtayed, or reſtrained by
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:93853:120"/>
either. (1) Intreaty, as 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 21. or (2) By Authority and Commands or (3) By ſtrength and force; all theſe ways you ſhould Remember to [keep] the Sabbath, if you keep not your heart with all keepings, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4. 23. You can never (keep) the Sabbath holy. The Plague of your heart (mentioned, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8. 38.) will not be ſtayed or reſtrained, unleſs you, (1) Offer upon Chriſt (your Altar, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 10.) Your Intreaties to God with <hi>David</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 21. and (2) Unleſs you lay Gods charge and command upon your extravagant heart to keep within compaſs, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 7. Yea and (3) You muſt uſe holy force and Violence (going but in Gods ſtregth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 71. 16.) to reſtrain your looſe, ſlippery and treacherous heart, both from wicked, and from worldly work on that day, for in the former work you keep the day to <hi>Satan,</hi> and in the latter to your ſelf, but not to your Saviour in either; beſides every wicked work is curſed Sin any day, but 'tis doubly ſo on the Lords-day, the ſeaſon being a great aggravation of the Sin, like that in, <hi>Eſt.</hi> 7. 8. 'tis a raviſhing the Queen of days before the very face of the King of Kings: and every Worldly work done on Gods-day can never expect Gods bleſſing, but will be a Canker, and may ſay with <hi>Jacob,</hi> I ſhall bring a curſe and not a bleſſing, <hi>Gen.</hi> 27. 12. he that did but gather a few ſticks (a ſmall buſineſs ſome may ſay) was paid home with

If you muſt do no manner of work, (ſave only the three works of Piety, Charity, and Neceſſity,) no manner of Worldly work, much leſs wicked work. O do not eat forbidden fruit, when you may eat of all the Trees in the garden, on your ſix days, do not your own works, (but ceaſe from them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 10.) nor ſpeak your own words on this high and holy day. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58. 13. <hi>Exod.</hi> 31. 14.</p>
            <p n="20">20. The eighth Direction is, never ſatiſfie your Soul with ſpending one Sabbath, without enjoying ſomething therein of the Lord God of Sabbath; never content your ſelf with <hi>Elijahs</hi> Mantle, without the Lord God of that Mantle, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 2. 14.

To miſs of a good friend is ſad, to meet him is joyful, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. 25. If you miſs of this your beſt friend, this will juſtly fadden you (as it did even <hi>Saul</hi> himſelf, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28. 15. If you meet him and miſs him not, If your friend (the King of Saints, <hi>Rev.</hi> 15. 3.) Sit at your Table, then your <hi>Spiknard</hi> will ſend forth the ſmell thereof, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 12. Such a ſign of ſweet friendſhip and fellowſhip muſt needs fill your heart with joy unſpeakable, and full of
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:93853:121"/>
glory (as it reminds and repreſents your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in Heaven) and make the Sabbath a delight (indeed) to you; then ſhall you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light your ſelf in the Lord and he will (not only) cauſe you to ride upon the high places of the Earth, but alſo, upon the heights of the Heavens, where you ſhall keep an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Sabbath (in which all Sabbaths meet) and whereof there is no evening. <hi>Iſ.</hi> 58. 13, 14. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. 4.</p>
            <p n="21">21. The ninth and laſt Direction is, be careful to cloſe up the Sabbath with a gracious frame of heart when (with <hi>Zacheus)</hi> you have got a view of your ſweet <hi>Jeſus</hi> from top to toe, upon the <hi>Sycomore Tree</hi> of ſome Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage (though low of ſtature in your ſelf) this is your after duty, be ſure you take Chriſt home with you, and joyfully receive him there, as he did, <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 3, 4, 5, 9. he is (you'l find) the moſt bleſſed gueſt that brings Salvation, with him as well as a Supper, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 20. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect then upon the whole carriage of your heart all the day; and falling down upon your knees. (1) Beg pardon for your drowſineſs or diſtraction, for your want of fervency of Spirit in ſerving the Lord, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 11. And a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath frame of Soul. (2) Return praiſe for the Angels moving the waters in order to any healing, either the weakneſs of your grace or the ſtrength of your Corruption: loſe not the warmth of the day in the cool of the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:93853:122"/>
for want of watchfulneſs; and let Sabbath day thoughts abide with you all the week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days, then week-day thoughts will leſs trouble you on the Sabbath day.</p>

            <p n="1">1. HItherto of the walk of a Chriſtian in perſonal Holineſs; a ſhort diſcourſe of his Relative Holineſs in the cloſe of all, Conſider the firſt, 'tis true, a man is, what he is in private and in perſonal Actions habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, either good or evil; and 'tis as true, that a man who is good privately and perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, cannot but be good Relatively alſo, he will labour to be good in all Relations: be will deſire and endeavour to be holy as a Father, as a Husband and as a Maſter; this holds true in all other Relations, Superiour, Inferiour or Equal, as a Wife, as a Child, and as a Servant Yea as a Magiſtrate, and as a Miniſter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All perſons are Really, what they are Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively;
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:93853:122"/>
unſound hearts (like the Piller of ſmoak in the Wilderneſs) will have a dark ſide, as well as a bright, becauſe they be not, what they ſeem to be, they be not to God, what they ſeem to be to men, you may not be like the Candle in a dark Lantern, that gives but light one way; but rather as the Candle ſet upon the Candleſtick that diſperſes its light every way, into every corner of the Houſe, you muſt not be diligent in one Relation, and negligent in another, but be holy in all Relations wherein God has ſet you.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſecond Conſideration is, Religion (in Truth) diſperſes it ſelf into every Relation, and makes the New-Creature, [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>] a publick-Creature, for the good of others, a bleſſing, <hi>(Gen.</hi> 12. 2.) to Family Relations, and ſo by conſequence to both Church and State, whereof a Family is the <hi>Epitome,</hi> being (as the <hi>Philoſopher</hi> ſaith) the firſt Society in Nature: as before the flood, [both] were bound up in private Families, as in a little volume: ſo now, the way to have both good, is to have Families good, whereof Churches and Kingdoms do conſiſt to make them as great <hi>Folios;</hi> Religious Families are bleſſed nurſeries out of which are tranſplanted a good Son into one place, a good Daughter into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and theſe bring a bleſſing along with them to thoſe ſeveral places, as <hi>Jacob</hi> did to <hi>Laban, Gen.</hi> 30. 27, 30. and <hi>Joſeph</hi> to <hi>Potiphar,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:93853:123"/>
Gen.</hi> 39. 23. thoſe two bleſſed branches of the <hi>Patriarks</hi> Families, (though tranſplanted into a Forraign Soil) carries a bleſſing to Forraign Countreys.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The third Conſideration is, ſeeing 'tis the Lord that ſets the Solitary in Families, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68. 6. and appoints the bounds of your habitation, <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 26. the placing of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in this or that place and habitation is from the appointment of the Lord thereof; as your being, ſo your dwelling is from the Lord, and this is not for wordly conveniency only, but for the worſhip of God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 6, 7. <hi>&amp;</hi> 11. 18. 19. which is your homage and quit-Rent, you muſt pay to the Lord of all, <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 36. <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 6. <hi>Deut.</hi> 26. 17. <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 19. Hereupon every new houſe was to be dedicated to God, <hi>Deu.</hi> 20. 5. with Prayers and Praiſes, as <hi>David</hi> did his, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 30. title, and as all ſhould be Sanctified, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 5. the walls of your houſe are ever before the Lord, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49. 16. and therefore Holineſs to the Lord ſhould ever be writ upon them, <hi>Zech.</hi> 14. 20. that your houſe may be as the houſe of <hi>David, Zech.</hi> 12. 8. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 101. 2. and as <hi>Melanctons</hi> Prince, a Church Court and Academy.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The fourth Conſideration is, in two branches. 1. Keep out Sin, that grand trouble houſe, <hi>Job</hi> 5. 24. <hi>&amp;</hi> 11. 14. <hi>&amp;</hi> 22. 23. do you viſit your habitation, 'tis a great mercy, deny'd to many; put Iniquity far from your
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:93853:123"/>
Tabernacle (by Repentance and Reformation) and while God fills your houſe with good things, do not you fill it with evil Sins. O let not this be your kindneſs to your friend, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 17. O do not thus requite the Lord, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 6. your houſe ſhould be all built of <hi>Iriſh-Oak</hi> (as it were) which cannot endure any venemous <hi>Spider</hi> to come near it; 2. You muſt keep in the <hi>Ark,</hi> as well as keep out Sin, thus did <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 101. 2, 3. he would ſet no wicked thing before him, yet he did the holy <hi>Ark,</hi> before which he danced with all his might 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6 14, 16, 17.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That you may be rightly guided in this laſt walk of a Chriſtian, to walk in your houſe with a perfect heart, as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 101. 2. and both keep out Sin, and keep in the <hi>Ark,</hi> to wit, Religion, as <hi>Obed-edom</hi> did and was bleſſed for ſo doing, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. 11. take theſe following directions (the ſecond thing propounded) which relates, Firſt, to the Governours of a Family, and Secondly, to the governed in it. Firſt to Governours, the (1) Direction is, whereſoever God hath ſet out the bounds of your habitation, <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 26. though God ſay to you, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. 13. <hi>(Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulun</hi> ſhall dwell by the Sea-ſhore) an unruly Neighbour, and that yields no good Air, and it may be not an houſe to your liking in all things, yet ſay, this is the place appointed me of God, and having God for your Portion
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:93853:124"/>
there cry with <hi>David,</hi> your lines are fallen to you in a pleaſant place, and that you have a goodly heritage, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. 9, 6. Gods company (to give all good things to you, <hi>Math.</hi> 7. 11. and to take all evil things from you) makes a Cottage, yea a Cave to become a Stately Court, and a Princely Palace, for where the King is there is the Court: though you have not all to your mind, yet this will make you ſay, you have all (as <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 33. 11. <hi>&amp;</hi> as <hi>Paul, Phil.</hi> 4. 18.) in having him, that hath all: yea though you have nothing (in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon) yet poſſeſſing all things in him. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 10. when you have got the Divine Art of contentment, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 12. O Remember how the great Architect of the World had not a houſe to put his head in (though he was the Carpenter, <hi>Mark.</hi> 6. 3. and the builder of all, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 10.) <hi>Math.</hi> 8. 20. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 7. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 9. and how thoſe great Favourites of Heaven wandred about in Sheep-skins, <hi>&amp;c. Heb.</hi> 11. 37. 38. Having no certain dwelling place. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 11. Suppoſe you have none (or but a mean one) on Earth; yet have you one (and that a Magnificent one) in Heaven, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 1.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The ſecond Direction is, having an habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation appointed you of God, be ſure you make the Lord your Counceller about a yoke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellow (whether you be Male or Female) if you have a call thereunto; Marriage <hi>[quaſi]</hi>
               <pb n="223" facs="tcp:93853:124" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Marre-age or Merry-age, 'tis the making or marring of you for your whole life; of all your civil affairs, there is none of the like Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance as this, having an Influence upon all your days you live in the World: 'tis like a ſtratagem in War, that cannot be recal'd when you will: according to your choice of a good or evil Spirit (you bring into your bed and boſom) you make your houſe a laſting Heaven or Hell; You are mine, and I am yours, <hi>[brevis quidem eſt Cantiuncula, longum vero Epiphonema]</hi> is a ſhort Song, but it hath a long underſong, therefore (an Errour herein being Irrecoverable) you have need of <hi>Argus</hi> his hundred Eyes, as well as <hi>Briareus</hi> his hundred hands, and of Gods Counſel (above all) that you lay not the foundation of a laſting ſorrow thereby; and that your <hi>Conjugium</hi> prove not a <hi>Conjurgium</hi> a continual croſſing (inſtead of comforting) one another, when two are in one yoke and each draws contrary ways to the other. Hereupon (ſome ſay) that <hi>Adam</hi> in his deep ſleep was praying for a meet help, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 21. and the Scripture ſaith expreſly, that <hi>Iſaac</hi> went out to confer with God (in Prayer and Meditation) about this weighty matter, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24. 63. a good Wife is from the Lord, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19. 14. And ſo is a good Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The third Direction is, let not that Doctrine of <hi>Devils</hi> (that forbids to Marry,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:93853:125" rendition="simple:additions"/>
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 1, 3.) hinder you, as if it were better to live upon the Common, or as if the unmar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried eſtate were more honourable (without regard to the proper and peculiar gift, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 7, 9.) for Marriage is honourable unto all, <hi>&amp;c. Heb.</hi> 13. 4. and God himſelf (not <hi>Cecrops, Lycurgus,</hi> or <hi>Numa)</hi> was the firſt Author and Inſtitutor of it and that in Paradiſe, yea and before the fall, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 22. hence 'tis cal'd the <hi>Covenant</hi> of God, <hi>Prov.</hi> 2. 17. and though <hi>Paul</hi> the unmarried <hi>(qua talis,</hi> as 'tis ſaid) went up to God (which was a great honour) yet <hi>Moſes</hi> that was married had God to come down to him, which was greater honour; deſpiſe not this Divine medicine, which if right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly applyed, is your Arrival at the fair Haven, marriage, <hi>quaſi</hi> merry-age, the ſweeteſt paſſage of your life, a reſt and center of your affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>Ruth</hi> 3. 1. that it may be well with you, this is deſireable (as well as honourable) in both Sexes, for the man miſſes his rib and would recover it, and the woman (the rib) would be in her place under the Arm a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
            <p n="8">8. The fourth Direction is, be careful to enter in by Gods way, into Gods <hi>Covenant,</hi> not as ſome that enter into Gods Ordinance, (to wit, Marriage) by the <hi>Devils</hi> portal; (to wit, fornication) ſo lays the Foundation of a curſe, and not of a bleſſing: the Apoſtle faith, let them marry only in the Lord,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:93853:125"/>
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 39. you muſt not marry in <hi>Pluto</hi> (the God of Riches) nor in <hi>Venus</hi> (the <hi>Goddeſs</hi> of pleaſure) as the <hi>Heathens feigned,</hi> but in the fear of the Lord; the <hi>Rabbins</hi> obſerve, that in the names of <hi>[Iſh</hi> and <hi>Iſhah]</hi> the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> names of Man and Woman, is included <hi>(Jah)</hi> the name of God, and that if you take out <hi>Jod</hi> and <hi>He,</hi> whereof the name <hi>(Jah)</hi> conſiſts, there remaineth nothing but <hi>(Eſch, Eſch,)</hi> which ſignifies fire, fire; the moral of it is good ſignifying, that if you marry in any manner but in the Lord, whoſe name is <hi>Jah, Pſal.</hi> 68. 4. there will be nothing but fire, fire, nothing but brawling and doleful diſſention, a fire that burneth to the fire of <hi>Hell;</hi> but if you marry in the Lord, you marry alſo with the Lord, and he cannot be abſent from his own Marriage; it was Chriſts preſence at a marriage that turn'd water into Wine, <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 2, 9. <hi>Jeſus</hi> muſt be Invited to your Marriage (as the principal gueſt) but by no means invite the <hi>Devil (quaſi</hi> do-evil) who is <hi>(Abaddon</hi> and <hi>Appollyon. Rev.</hi> 9. 11.) the deſtroyer of all good; Except the Lord be with you to build your houſe (even in your foundation work, which is always ſerious and weighty work) all your indeavours will be but <hi>(Arena ſine Calce)</hi> ſand without lime that cannot hang together, but like untempered Morter, will fall aſunder, and you build in vain, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 127.
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:93853:126" rendition="simple:additions"/>
1. 2. Except and except, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 'Tis vain and 'tis vain, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Should found in your Ears.</p>
            <p n="9">9. The fifth Direction is, if God have made you the husband of a Wife (eſpecially of ſuch a one as hath the ſeven qualifications of a good one, to wit, grace, race, face, arts, parts, portion, proportion,) then (1) Be thankful to your God for ſo great a bleſſing, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116. 12. this was one of the firſt real and and royal gifts that God beſtowed on <hi>Adam,</hi> and that upon deliberation of Divine wiſdom, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 18. the Trinity in the unity had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted before about mans firſt being, (let us make man, <hi>&amp;c. Gen.</hi> 1. 26.) Now the Unity in the Trinity conſults about mans well-being, and determins 'tis not good for man to be alone <hi>(I will make him an help-meet for him)</hi> a piece ſo exactly cut out for him, as anſwers him rightly in every Joint; no ſuch glorious Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture could <hi>Adam</hi> find among all the Creatures that paſſed before him, hence the woman is the glory of a Man, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 7. O bleſs God for ſuch a glorious Creature, and rejoice at the recovery of your loſt Rib, <hi>Cant.</hi> 3. 11. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice in the Lord the giver of that mercy, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 31. for marriages are made in Heaven, before they be Solemnized on Earth; 'tis the work of God the Creator to provide an help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meet for Man his Creature, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 18. <hi>Prov.</hi> 18. 22. <hi>Prov.</hi> 19. 14. And (2) Live with your Wife (that God hath graciouſly given you)
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:93853:126"/>
as a Man of knowledg, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 7. where ſhould knowledg and wiſdom be, but in the head, if you have found (by ſeeking God in Prayer as <hi>Iſaac</hi> did) a Wife, that is, a good Wife (as name is uſed, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7. 1. for a good name and Wool, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 1. 18. for white Wool) you have found a good thing, a fit and faithful yoke fellow is a ſingular bleſſing, and you have obtained favour of the Lord, <hi>Prov.</hi> 18. 22. as this calls for abundance of praiſe to your God, ſo for abundance of prudence to your Conſort, which is the weaker Veſſel, and ſo ought to be handled as a Venice glaſs with all tenderneſs even as Chriſt and his Church, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 29.</p>
            <p n="10">10. The ſixth Direction is, if God make you the head and Governour of an houſe and Family, then learn in the firſt place to rule your little houſe well, to wit, your ſelf, he that hath no rule over his own Spirit, is very unfit to take the rule over others, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14. 29. <hi>&amp;</hi> 16. 32. and <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7. 9. Anger may ruſh into a wiſe-mans boſom, but it ſhall not reſt there, he dare not let the Sun go down upon ſo evil a gueſt and Counſeller; ſury dwells and domineers in no houſe or heart (not only till the Sun go down a whole day) but while it go round (a whole year,) <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 26. but where a fool is the Maſter of the Family, a troubler of his own houſe that brings all to nothing, <hi>Prov.</hi> 11. 29. his livelihood (by a ſecret curſe)
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:93853:127"/>
Vaniſhes into Smoak, and if not his life (by fretting) yet his liberty goes away, for he ſhall be ſervant to the wiſe in heart; none Triumphed in <hi>Rome</hi> but ſuch as had five Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; nor you in Heaven without Victory over your five ſenſes.</p>
            <p n="11">11. The ſeventh Direction is, be careful to lead an Exemplary and a convincing Life, that you may be a pattern of Piety to your whole Family; patterns are ſo prevalent (both to good and evil) that <hi>Pelagius</hi> did think (though amiſs) Sin came into and is continued in the World by imitation and not by propagation; be ſure you ſhew Piety at home (as well as abroad,) 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 4. and be not like the ſtage-Players, that act the part of both great and good men upon the ſtage, but follow them into the Tiring-Houſe (where they diſ-robe themſelves) and then it will appear they are but very <hi>Rogues</hi> and <hi>vile-Varlots;</hi> every man is, what he is at home and in private.

to your Husband what <hi>Davids</hi> harp was to <hi>Saul</hi> in his fury and Phrenſy; 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 23. when your Husband is at any time (as who is not at ſome time) tranſported into paſſion; ſee that you caſt <hi>Milk</hi> and not <hi>Oile</hi> upon the flames of his Anger, that you may quench that fire and not more enflame it by adding another fire (your own anger,) to it, 'twas once a bleſſed Expedient in a godly Couple (though both Cholerick) to live lovingly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for forty years, without ever any fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings out betwixt them, by yeilding evermore to each others paſſions, and never being angry both together.</p>

and not only the Ark of God, but alſo God himſelf, Ariſe [thou] and the Ark of thy ſtrength,) <hi>Pſal.</hi> 132. 8. where Religion is ſet up, that houſe is [a <hi>Beth-el]</hi> an houſe of God and there is the gate of Heaven, <hi>Gen</hi> 28. 16. 17. not only for your Prayers aſcending up to God, but alſo for his bleſſings deſcending down upon you, for he is Rich unto all perſons and Families that call upon him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 12. <hi>Job.</hi> 8. 6. whether you be ſmall or great, God is not an Auſtere Maſter but a liberal pay Maſter, but that houſe wherein the Worſhip of God is not, nor any calling upon his Name 'tis not a <hi>Bethel,</hi> but a <hi>Beth-Aven, Hoſ.</hi> 10. 5. an houſe of Sin, and God will poure out his curſe upon it and not his bleſſing, <hi>Jer.</hi> 10. 25.

            <p n="15">15. Secondly a ſhort word of Direction to the Governed, as they ſtand related to the Governours, (1.) In General; to all ſuch, whether Children or Servants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The firſt Rule is, account it your mercy and priviledg and not your burden, that you live in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Families where Prayer, Reading, Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chizing,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:93853:129"/>
yea order and diſcipline are obſerved, <hi>Gen.</hi> 16. 8. &amp; 18. 19. Children of many Prayers and Servants of many Prayers and Spiritual helps may not ſay, what a wearineſs is this, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 13. 'twas curſed <hi>Jeroboam</hi> that ſaid, 'tis too much to do ſo, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 12. 28. Yea 'twas the mad and raging <hi>Heathens</hi> that cryed, let us break theſe bands aſunder and caſt away thoſe cords from us, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 3. Thoſe are Children of <hi>[Belial]</hi> that like not to be yoked (as the word ſignifies) no not with Chriſts eaſy yoak, and thoſe are the Redeemed of the Lord that look on Family duties (not as Cords and Bands, but as garters and girdles to confine them where they ought to be, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 22. Chriſt left this pattern for all Families by the ordering of his own, as (1) To wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 22. (2) To keep the Sabbath <hi>Luke</hi> 4. 16. (3) To pray with the Family, <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 18. (alone there is meant apart from the Multitude, for his Diſciples (which were his Family) were with him, (4) To pray privately or ſecretly by himſelf, <hi>Luke</hi> 5. 16. (5) And that morning and evening, <hi>Mark</hi> 1. 35. <hi>&amp; Math.</hi> 14. 23. And (6) This was his practice and cuſtome, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 39. yea (7) Sometimes all night long, <hi>Luke</hi> 6. 12. And (laſtly) with Submiſſion and Devotion as a Servant of God, <hi>Math.</hi> 26. 39. Governours and governed [learn of him <hi>Math.</hi> 11. 29.] he is your beſt Maſter, all this Practice of Piety,

'tis no matter how dull the Scholler be (if but deſirous to learn) ſo Chriſt himſelf be but your Teacher.</p>
            <p n="16">16. Secondly in particular. Firſt to Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, the ſecond Rule is, Obey your Parents, <hi>Eph</hi> 6. 1. as <hi>Iſaao</hi> did <hi>Abraham</hi> in ſubmitting to be Sacrificed (though he was then grown up and might have reſiſted) and as Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came obedient even to the death of the Croſs. Good Children help to lengthen their Parents days, as <hi>Joſeph</hi> did <hi>Jacobs;</hi> God therefore in the firſt Commandment promiſes (by way of requital) to lengthen theirs; Remember you are [ſtars] in <hi>Joſephs</hi> dream (who was [himſelf] a whole conſtellation of graces,) O be a bright and morning Star in Chriſt who is ſo called, <hi>Revel.</hi> 22. 16. be a morning-ſeeker in the morning of your life, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 17. and grow in wiſdom as well as in ſtature, and in favour with God and man as the Child <hi>(Jeſus)</hi> did. <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 52. but be not a blazing meteor, not a falling, but a fixed Star, not <hi>(Sancti Juvenes &amp; Satanici Senes)</hi> not degenerate plants, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 21. Degenerating, not only from your Godly Parents (though a Child of many Prayers cannot eaſily miſcarry, as <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe</hi> told <hi>Monica</hi> concerning <hi>Auſtin</hi> (her Son) while a <hi>Manichee.)</hi> But from your ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing godly ſelf in your younger years; a fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Star, falls not to the Earth only, but (as the Star (wormwood,) <hi>Rev.</hi> 8. 11. bitter

to Parents and ſelf) into the bottomleſs Pit alſo, and is it not pitty that any one chip of the good old blocks ſhould become fewel for everlaſting burnings.</p>
            <p n="17">17. The third Rule is, be a Serving Son, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 17. 'tis an old and yet a true ſaying, that God, Parents and School Maſters can never be requited both for your being and for your well being; Parents have power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the ſervice of their Children, and as it is the Parents priviledg to command ſervice, ſo 'tis Childrens duty to do ſervice; even churliſh <hi>Laban</hi> had ſerving Sons, <hi>Gen.</hi> 30. 35. and ſo had the old ſeducing Prophet, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 13. 13. yea and the Prince or Prieſt of <hi>Midian</hi> had ſerving Daughters, <hi>Exod.</hi> 2. 16. This is the honour that God commands Children to pay to their Parents, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 12. Children can never do enough for their Parents, that have done ſo much (and alſo ſuffred ſo much) for them; 'tis very remarkable, that good <hi>Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> (who was otherwiſe a truly ſerving Son) was taken by Lot, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. 42. the whole diſpoſing whereof is of the Lord, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16. 33. and this may well be ſuppoſed to be ſome Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that God hereby did ſhew how tender he is in allowing the leaſt ſhew of diſobedience to Superiours, and to make Children fear and avoid (even) the Raſh and cauſeleſs curſes of Parents, which (by a ſecret Judgment of God)
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:93853:131"/>
are ſometimes inflicted, a wiſe (ſerving) Son, makes a glad Father, <hi>&amp;c. Prov.</hi> 10. 1. every Son ſhould be an <hi>(Abner)</hi> which ſignifies his Fathers light, and every Daughter an <hi>(Abigail)</hi> which ſignifies her Fathers joy. O then whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you be Son or Daughter, do not bring down the gray hairs of your Parents with ſorrow to the grave, <hi>Gen.</hi> 42. 38. <hi>&amp;</hi> 44. 31.</p>
            <p n="18">18. The fourth Rule is, you muſt nouriſh your Parents in their old Age, that nouriſhed you in your youth, and as you expect that your Children ſhould nouriſh you when you are old; good <hi>Joſeph</hi> is a bleſſed pattern, <hi>Gen.</hi> 45. 9, 10, 11. Saying to his old Father, come down to me, and be near to me, and there will I nouriſh thee, and he did ſo, <hi>Gen.</hi> 47. 12. and <hi>Obed</hi> was a reſtorer of life to old <hi>Naomai</hi> whoſe life had been long a lifeleſs life as it had been joyleſs) and a nouriſher of her old Age, <hi>Ruth.</hi> 4. 15. See <hi>Davids</hi> love herein, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22. 3. And Chriſts alſo (the myſtical <hi>David,) Joh.</hi> 19. 27. This the Apoſtle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends, as a thing not only good before men, but alſo acceptable unto God, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 4. and Chriſt reproves the neglect of it, <hi>Math.</hi> 15 4. and <hi>Paul</hi> calls ſuch [<gap reason="foreign">

The infernal Ravens ſhall pick out the Eye of him that mocketh his Parents, as curſed <hi>Cham</hi> did bleſſed <hi>Noah;</hi> yea God oft repays them again in the ſame Coin, as one ungracious Son (I Read of) that kicked his Father down the Stares, and dragged him by the hair of the head to turn him out of doors, and for this end opening the door, the old Father then ſpake ſaying; Now Son it is enough, do no more, for thus far I went with my Father, however God will take them to task as he did <hi>Abimelech,</hi> and render to them the wickedneſs done to their Parents, <hi>Judg.</hi> 9. 5. 56. And he was a Son of more wit then grace, who, when his Father complained that never Father had ſuch an undutiful Child, as he had; replyed, yes my Grandfather, meaning his Father (when a Child) whom he ſpake to.</p>
            <p n="19">19. The fifth Rule is, if you be a Son or Daughter that fears, your Parents have left you <hi>Job's</hi> Legacy, laying up iniquity for you as well as Inheritance. <hi>Job</hi> 21. 19. as 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. 29. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 5. 27. and <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 5. Yet know none ſhall be damned eternally for their Parents Sin, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 17. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 6. unleſs they make it their own, either by commiſſion or approbation; yet may they be puniſhed Temporally; yea though they prove good
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:93853:132"/>
Children, as 1 <hi>King.</hi> 14. 12, 13. and that you may eſcape this, you muſt bewail your Parents Sins. <hi>Ez.</hi> 9. 6, 7. <hi>&amp; Dan.</hi> 9. 4, 6, 8. <hi>&amp; Deut.</hi> 21. 13. and as to the goods you derive from them, you ſhould do with them as you do with fruit out of the hands of ſome dirty <hi>Huckſter,</hi> you muſt waſh them over again and then you may uſe them; to the pure, all things are pure. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 15. beſides grace cuts of the entail (though the oldeſt and ſtrongeſt) of wickedneſs, as a good Child may come from a bad Father (as <hi>Ahaz</hi> had an <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 18. 1. and <hi>Amon</hi> a <hi>Joſiah,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 21. 21, 26.) So a good Child may have a ſanctified uſe of the goods of bad Parents, as thoſe two good Sons had of the Treaſures of bad Fathers.</p>
            <p n="20">20. The ſixth and laſt Rule is, Secondly to Servants, pleaſe your Maſters in all things, not anſwering again (either by chatting or thwarting,) <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 9. The old ſaying is, be it better be it worſe, pleaſe him that bears the Purſe; not with Eye-ſervice, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 5, 6. 'Tis not enough for you to fear man (your Maſter) who hath power over the fleſh only, but you muſt fear God, <hi>Col.</hi> 4. 22. who hath power to caſt Body and Soul into Hell, <hi>Math.</hi> 10. 28. not one ſervant went into the <hi>Ark</hi> with <hi>Noah,</hi> nor out of <hi>Sodom</hi> with <hi>Lot,</hi> which ſhows that few Servants be good, O
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:93853:132"/>
be you of the Number of the few, that takes ſome time for your Soul; If Servants under the Law did ſo (that were Slaviſh bond-men and bond-women) much more you under the Goſpel; <hi>Abraham</hi> had a faithful and a pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Servant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24. 10, 16, 27, 45. and <hi>Jacob</hi> was no leſs to <hi>Laban,</hi> and <hi>Joſeph</hi> to <hi>Potiphar,</hi> and the <hi>Centurion</hi> was happy in his Servants, <hi>Math.</hi> 8. 6.

            <p n="1">1.

            <p n="2">2. If you be the Father of the Family, then are you as the Sun, if the Mother thereof, then are you as the Moon, and if Children, then are you of the Stars, as in <hi>Joſephs</hi> dream, <hi>Gen.</hi> 37. 9.

(2) You muſt be a Prieſt (the word is uſed in Latin for he and ſhe) to Sanctify your Family and familiarity, by the Sacrifice of Prayer dayly. Thus did <hi>Job.</hi> Chap. 1. 5. well knowing he was bound to the preſervation of Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts as well as to the Obſervation of them, and to ſee that all his (under his ſhadow, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14. 7.) ſhould keep them as well as himſelf; he ſues for pardon even of ſuſpected Sins in his Sons, and turns his ſuſpicion into a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication; and this <hi>Job</hi> did <hi>[Kolhajomim]</hi> continually or every day.
